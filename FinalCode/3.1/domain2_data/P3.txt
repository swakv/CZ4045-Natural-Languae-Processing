Field of the Description.0002 The present invention relates, in general, to fabrication of three dimensional (3D) objects, and, more particularly,to a filament-based 3D printer (and corresponding 3D printing method) specially configured and operable to print 3Dobjects having two or more colors (e.g., to print multi-colored3D objects).0003 2. Relevant Background0004 3D printing is an additive technology in whichobjects (or “printed 3D objects”) are created from a digitalfile. The digital file may be generated from software such as acomputer aided design (CAD) program or another 3D modeling program or with a 3D scanner to copy an existing objectthat provides input to a 3D modeling program. To prepare thedigital file for printing, Software, provided on a printer-interfacing computer or running on the 3D printer itself, slices the3D model into hundreds to thousands of horizontal layers.Typically, only the outer wall or “shell' is printed to be solidsuch that a shell thickness may be defined as part of modifying the 3D model for use in printing, and, during printing, theshell is printed as a solid element while the interiorportions ofthe 3D object are printed in a honeycomb or other infill design(e.g., to reduce the amount of material that has to be printed toprovide the printed 3D object).0005. When the prepared digital file of the 3D object isuploaded into the 3D printer, the 3D printer creates the objectlayer-by-layer. The 3D printer reads every slice (or 2D image)from the 3D model and proceeds to create the 3D object bylaying down (or printing) Successive layers of material untilthe entire object is created. Each of these layers can be seen asa thinly sliced horizontal cross section of the eventually completed or printed 3D object.0006. One of the more common 3D printer technologiesuses fused deposition modeling (FDM) or, more generally,fused filament fabrication (FFF). FDM printers work by usinga plastic filament (e.g., acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS)or polylactic acid (PLA) provided as strands of filament thatis 1 to 3 millimeters in diameter) that is unwound from a coilor spool mounted onto the printer housing. The plastic filament is used to Supply material to a print head with an extrusion noZZle, e.g., a gear pulls the filament off the spool andinto the extrusion nozzle. The extrusion nozzle is adapted toturn its flow on and off. The extrusion nozzle (or an upstreamportion of the print head) is heated to melt the plastic filamentas it is passed into, or through, the extrusion nozzle so that itliquefies. The pointed extrusion nozzle deposits the liquefiedmaterial in ultra fine lines (e.g., in lines that are about 0.1millimeters across).0007. The extrusion head and its outlet are moved in bothhorizontal and Vertical directions to complete or print eachlayer of the 3D model by a numerically controlled mechanismthat is operated or controlled by control software running onthe 3D printer (e.g., a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM)software package adapted for use with the 3D printer). Theextruded melted or liquefied material quickly solidifies toform a layer (and to seal together layers of the 3D object), andthe extrusion noZZle is then moved vertically prior to startingprinting of the next layer. This process is repeated until alllayers of the 3D object have been printed. The print surface,which may be called a print bed or build plate, is often heatedDec. 31, 2015also to avoid having the bottom layer of plastic of the 3Dobject curling up during printing.0008 Presently, 3D printers are significantly limited in thenumber of colors they can use to make 3D objects. Forexample, many 3D printers only have one print head, whichmeans that objects are printed in one color (i.e., the color ofthe plastic filament). To print in more than one color, the printjob has to be stopped and the filament switched out to providefilament of a different color. Some printers, though, may havetwo or more print heads each supplied by a different filamentspool so that they can be used to print different colors withoutstopping a print job as the 3D printer can select different printheads to print different colors in the 3D object. However, theaddition of two or more print heads along with separate material-supply spools makes the 3D printer much more complexto build and control, which, in turn, drives up its cost. Additionally, the color of the 3D object is still limited to thenumber of print heads and the colors in which the plasticfilament is available. For example, most 3D printers will belimited to two or three colors unless the filament is changedout during the print process.0009 Hence, there remains a need for a new 3D printerthat allows a 3D object to be printed in multiple colors.Preferably, such 3D printers would be relatively simple tooperate and manufacture and would allow operators to continue to use digital files defining 3D models to print theirmulti-color 3D objects.SUMMARY0010 Briefly, a 3D printer is described that is adapted forprinting multi-colored 3D objects. The 3D printer is configured to use a neutral-colored filament (e.g., a white plasticfilament, a gray plastic filament, or other neutral-coloredfilament) as the Supply material rather than a colored plasticfilament as in prior 3D printers. The 3D printer provides amulti-colored printing functionality by coloring the neutralcolored filament immediately prior to printing, e.g., after it ispulled into a print head and liquefied by a heater (in the heador in the extrusion nozzle) but prior to extrusion from theextrusion nozzle.0011 To this end, two or more dye supply tanks (e.g.,Supplies of a dye such as an ink via an ink cartridge) areprovided on or in the 3D printer housing, and the 3D printercontroller operates to selectively output volumes of dye fromthe two or more dye (orink) Supply tanks to inject colored dye(e.g., ink or the like) into the extrusion noZZle (or into amixing reservoir upstream from the extrusion nozzle) to colorthe liquefied print supply material (e.g., melted ABS, PLA, orplastic). In one embodiment, four dye Supply tanks (e.g., inkcartridges) are provided to selectively Supply red, green, blue,and black dyes (e.g., RGB and black inks or other colorants)to the print head to mix and color the neutral-colored filamentmaterial in or upstream of the extrusion nozzle (e.g., the term“neutral-colored' is intended to include any easy-to-dye (orcolor) plastic Such as a white plastic, a clear plastic, a translucent plastic, or other easy-to-die plastic (which may even bea darker color such as black if the plastic takes on colors of theinjected dye)). In this manner, the 3D printer may be operatedor controlled to print in nearly any color (e.g., a color rangesimilar to that found in an inkjet printer).0012. In some embodiments, the 3D printertakes a digitalfile as input that defines a full-color 3D model of an object,and the control Software for the printer is adapted to recognizethe color definitions of the 3D model and, in response, toUS 2015/0375451 A1selectively output a dye (such as an ink) from the dye Supplytanks (e.g., ink cartridges) to print plastic material that hasbeen colored or dyed to be a color matching that of the 3Dmodel (e.g., first printing a first portion of a layer that is blue,second printing a second portion of the layer that is orange,third printing a third portion of the layer that is yellow, and soon). The 3D printer, therefore, can use a single print head toprint liquefied plastic having any of plurality of colors whileusing a single filament type pulled from a single materialSupply spool.0013 More particularly, a printer is provided that isadapted for printing three dimensional (3D) objects withmaterial having two or more colors. The printer includes aprint head with an extrusion nozzle having an outlet, a mixingchamber upstream of the outlet, and a heated portion. Theprinter also includes a print bed with a Surface for receivingmaterial extruded from the outlet of the extrusion nozzle anda print material Supply. The print material Supply, e.g., afilament spool, that is loaded with a filament of a neutralcolored or easily stained/dyed plastic. Then, the print headcan be adapted for drawing the filament into the heated portion to liquefy the neutral-colored plastic upstream of or in themixing chamber. The printer also includes a dye Supplyassembly fluidically coupled with the mixing chamber toSupply dye to the mixing chamber, whereby the liquefiedplastic is colored by the supplied dye prior to being extrudedfrom the outlet of the extrusion nozzle.0014. In some embodiments, the neutral-colored (or easily-colored/dyed) plastic is a white plastic (ABS or PLA orthe like), a gray plastic, a beige plastic, or a light blue plastic.The supplied dye can be first provided with a first color andsecond provided with a second color differing from the firstcolor. In some cases, the printer head is adapted to selectivelydraw or pump the Supplied dye into the mixing chamber.Then, the dye Supply assembly can include at least two dyetanks (orink cartridges) containing dyes (e.g., inks) of at leasttwo differing colors. In such embodiments, the printer headdraws or pumps the Supplied dye from the at least two dyetanks during at least two time periods to sequentially color theliquefied plastic at least two differing colors. In the same orother embodiments, the printer head draws or pumps thesupplied dye from two or more of the at least two dye tanksconcurrently to color the liquefied plastic by mixing dye oftwo or more colors. The printer may also include a controlleradapted to process a digital file (e.g., defining a model of a 3Dobject including a plurality of colored elements) so as todefine a plurality of print layers and to operate the print headto print the print layers with the Supplied ink having colorsmatching colors of the plurality of colored elements.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS0015 FIG. 1 is a functional block diagram of a 3D printersystem during printing operations to provide a multi-color 3Dobject with a single print head and a single material Supply(e.g., a single spool loaded with neutral-colored plastic filament);0016 FIG. 2 is a flow diagram for a method of fabricatingor printing a multi-colored 3D object using a filament-based3D printer such as with use of the system of FIG. 1; and0017 FIGS. 3-6 illustrate perspective top, back, side, andbottom views, respectively, of a 3D printer of one usefuldesign according to the present description.Dec. 31, 2015DETAILED DESCRIPTION0018. The inventors recognized that there were significantlimitations with conventional three dimensional (3D) printersthat rely on the use of different color plastic filament (or printmaterials) to print a 3D object in more than one color. Toaddress these limitations, a 3D printer is described that uses aneutral-colored filament (or print material) that is fed into asingle print head rather than having a different print head foreach color.0019 Prior to extrusion from the print head outlet or extrusion nozzle, the 3D printer is adapted to dye or color thefilament as or after it is liquefied or melted into liquid plastic.To this end, the 3D printer includes two or more ink cartridges(or other supplies of dye or coloring material withink’ beingone form of dye in the following description and claims) thatcan be used by a printer controller to color the liquefied ormelted filament one of two or more colors (e.g., a color set ordefined by a full color digital model of a 3D object). Thecolored and liquid plastic is then extruded from the extrusionnozzle of the print head, which has been positioned by theprint controller relative to a build plate, so as to print a 3Dobject having two or more colors, e.g., a multi-colored 3Dobject.(0020 FIG. 1 illustrates a 3D print system 100 configuredto allow an operator to print 3D objects having two or morecolors while only requiring a single print head and a singleprint material Supply (e.g., a single color of plastic filament).As shown, the system 100 includes a 3D printer 110 and aprinterinterface system 150. The printerinterface system 150may be a desktop computer, a workstation, a laptop or padcomputer, or other computer device operable by a user of the3D printer 110 to select and transmit a full-color digital model169 to the 3D printer 110 for use in printing a 3D object 170.To this end, the printer interface system 150 includes a processor or central processing unit (CPU) 152 that operates ormanages input and output (I/O) devices 154 Such as a monitor, a touchscreen, a mouse, a keyboard, speakers, Voice recognition devices, and the like that allow an operator or user ofthe system 150 to provide user input.0021 Particularly, the printer interface system 150 mayinclude memory devices or data storage components (e.g.,computer readable medium) 160 (or have access to suchmemory devices) that are managed by the processor 152 tostore one or more digital files 162 that are used to print a 3Dobject 170. Also, the system 150 may use the CPU 152 toexecute code or software (in computer readable medium Suchas RAM, ROM, or the like on the system 150) in the form ofa 3D printer interface program 156. The interface program156 may be downloaded onto the system 150 to allow anoperator to interact with the 3D printer 110 and its printcontroller 130, and the 3D printer 110 may provide this software/program 156 upon a first link of the system 150 and the3D printer 110 or the software/program 156 may be downloaded separately (e.g., by inserting a CD into the system 150,by accessing a web site associated with the 3D printer 110, orthe like).0022. In practice, the 3D printer interface program 156may be adapted to cause a series of interface Screens to bepresented by the system 150 and the I/O devices 154 to a user.The user may select a 3D object for printing by first generating a 3D model 164 of a 3D object, and this definition mayalso include setting a thickness for an outer shell of object 170and a structural infill (e.g., one or more honeycomb patterns).Significantly, the 3D object model 164 may include a pluralUS 2015/0375451 A1ity of object elements orportions 166, and each of these objectelements or portions 166 may be assigned a color 168. Alternatively, a color map may be provided in the digital file 162defining colors for differing portions 166 of the 3D objectmodel 164. The available colors for color definition 168 mayvary to practice the system 100 but are at least two differentcolors. The available colors will depend upon the number ofinks or dyes provided in the ink/dye tanks 124 and whetherthe print controller 130 is adapted to mix these differentlycolored inks or dyes. Typically, the color map or definition168 will only apply to the shell of the model 164 and printed3D object to limit the amount of ink or coloring dye that hasto be used from tanks/cartridges 124 (e.g., with the infill beingprinted using plastic in the base color of the neutral-coloredfilament).0023. In some embodiments, two or more colored inks,Such as red, green, and blue, are provided in tanks/cartridges124 and the printer control program 134 is adapted to bothselect a single cartridge 124 (i.e., a single color) for use inprinting but also to mix the colors to obtain a plurality ofcolors (i.e., nearly any color when all three cartridges areused). The printer interface program 156 may be adapted toprovide a listing of available colors for color definitions 168with a particular 3D printer 110 while some embodimentsmay configure the print control program 134 to recognize allcolors in definition 168 and convert these to colors availablewith separate use or mixing of ink/dye tanks 124. Then,during operations, the printerinterface system 150 is operableto communicate (wirelessly or in a wired manner) with the 3Dprinter 110 including transmitting a full color digital model169 (or send the digital file 162 to the 3D printer) to the 3Dprinter 110 for use by the print control program 134 to print amulti-color 3D object 170 (in other cases, the print controlprogram 134 accesses the digital file 162 in the memory 160,as needed for printing, rather than transmitting the model 169to the 3D printer).0024. The 3D printer 110 includes a build plate or printbed 112 with an upper or exposed surface 113 upon whichmelted—and colored plastic is printed from a print head114 to form a multi-colored 3D object 170. This can be seenin FIG. 1 with the 3D object 170 having differing elements orportions 172,174, 176, and each may be printed in a differentcolor (or the shell portion of each object element/portion 172,174, 176 may be printed in a different color). To this end, the3D printer 110 includes a print head 114 with a heated extrusion nozzle 116 with a pointed tip/outlet 118 from whichcolored, liquid plastic is ejected or extruded to build up theobject 170 layer-by-layer. In some cases, the heated extrusionnozzle 116 may include a heater or heat coil about a tubewhile in other cases a mixing chamber is provided immediately upstream of the tip/outlet 118 to allow mixing of ink/dyeand liquefied or melted plastic to color the plastic prior toextrusion.0025. Further, the 3D printer 110 includes a print materialsupply in the form of a supply spool 120 upon which iswrapped or wound a length of plastic. Particularly, the plasticis provided as a neutral-colored filament 122 that can bedrawn as shown by arrow 123 into the extrusion nozzle 116where it is melted or liquefied by a heater. For example, thefilament 122 may take the form of ABS, PLA, or other plasticuseful in 3D printing that is white, gray, beige, lightblue, andthe like.0026. To provide color to this plastic filament 122, the 3Dprinter 110 includes two or more ink/dye cartridges or tanksDec. 31, 2015124 each containing a volume of a different color of ink ordye, which can be pumped or drawn as shown with arrow 125into the print head 114 for mixing with the liquid/meltedplastic provided by filament 122 (e.g., in a mixing chamberportion of the extrusion nozzle 116) downstream of the heateror within the heated portion of the nozzle 116. The ink fromcartridges 124 may be fed 125 into the head 114 one at a timeor, more typically, two or more at a time to allow more colorsto be provided in the object 170 than the number of inkcartridges 124. For example, red, green, and blue ink may beprovided in separate cartridges 124 to allow red, green, andblue plastic to be printed in elements/portions 172,174, 176or any color producible by mixing these three colors in equalor unequal portions.(0027. The 3D printer 110 includes a controller 130 forinterfacing with the printer interface system 150 so as to printa multi-colored 3D object 170 based on the digital file 162.The controller 130 includes a processor 132 executing orrunning Software/code in the form of a print control program134 (e.g., code in computer readable media accessible by theCPU 132). The print control program 134 is configured toselectively cause the filament 122 to be drawn (e.g., withgearing or the like) 123 from the spool 120 into the head 114while also selectively injecting one or more colors of ink/dyefrom ink tanks/cartridges 124 (note, in some object portions172, 174, or 176 no ink is added such that the object 170includes the neutral-colored plastic in the shell and/or in theinfill of the object 170). The print control program 134 recognizes color definitions 168 in the 3D object model 164 anduses this recognized information to select which cartridges124 to use and what amounts to achieve a desired color. Theprint control program 134 also operates to move the printhead 114 within a layer and to a new layer to print the 3Dobject 170 (e.g., to provide 3D printing, layer-by-layer as isknown by those skilled in the art of 3D printing). In each layerof the 3D object 170, the plastic may be one, two, three, ormore colors matching or exceeding the number of ink cartridges 124.0028 FIG. 2 illustrates a 3D printing method 200 that maybe performed according to the present description Such as byoperation of the system 100 of FIG. 1 or the 3D printer shownin FIG. 3-6. The method 200 starts at 205 Such as with communicatively linking a printer interface system/computerwith a 3D printer, with installing/replacing colored-ink cartridges on the 3D printer for a desired set of print colors, withloading a print material onto a feed spool (e.g., a neutralcolored plastic filament), and with providing 3D printer-touser device interface software on a user's printer interfacesystem/computer. In some cases, the 3D printer also has to beallowed time to warm up including heating an extrusionnozzle and/or ink-and-plastic mixing chamber to a temperature within a useful plastic liquefying/melting range.0029. The method 200 continues at 210 with generating a3D model of an object or retrieving/selecting a previouslygenerated 3D model. The 3D model includes a mapping ofcolors onto at least the shell or exterior layer(s) of the 3Dobject or color definitions for each object element or region ofthe modeled 3D object. Again, as discussed above, the colorsmay be two or more in number. The method 200 continues at220 with transmitting the digital file with the 3D model to a3D printer configured for multi-colored printing as taughtherein (or the controller of the 3D printer may access amemory device storing the digital file as needed in step 220and during printing with Such transmittal).US 2015/0375451 A10030. In step 230, the method 200 continues with the 3Dprinter control or printing Software functioning to process the3D model of the object. This processing includes definingprint layers or thin slices of the 3D model of the object for usein printing a 3D object. In step 230, the 3D printing softwareidentifies or recognizes different colors, which may includeone, two, or more colors in each layer and may include assigning Such colors to only the shell portion of each layer to limitthe amount of ink used for 3D printing. Additionally, theprocessing in step 230 may involve converting a defined orchosen color for an object element or portion to a color thatcan be provided by the 3D printer or its current set or combination of colored inkS/dyes (e.g., plastic coloring materials).These colors may then be mapped onto the differing regionsor areas of the object layers.0031. The method 200 continues at 240 with determining(e.g., with the printing Software running on the 3D printer)whether there are additional layers to be printed. If so, themethod 200 continues at 250 with retrieving the next layerdefinition including color maps/definitions. At 254, themethod 200 continues with drawing additional amounts ofthe neutral-colored print material (plastic filament or the like)into the print head Such as by operating an electric motor toturn gears engaging the filament. At 260, the method 200continues with heating the print material Such as ABS plasticto liquefy it.0032. Then, at 270, the method 200 includes selectivelyinjecting ink into the mixing chamber or reservoir (or heatedportion of the nozzle or portion of the nozzle downstream ofthis heated portion) to color the neutral-colored and nowliquid print material. This may involve injecting no ink whenthe printing is of the print material “as is such as for the infillportion of the printed 3D object. In other cases such as in theshell portion of the printed 3D object, step 270 includesinjecting one-to-three or more colored inks (again, it shouldbe remembered that herein “ink' is one of any number of dyeswhich may be nearly any coloring material useful to color theprint material) to achieve the color in the color map/definitioncorresponding to the present portion of the layer being printed(or present location of the heads outlet or extrusion nozzle).0033. At step 280, the method 200 includes extruding thenow colored liquid print material onto the print bed or previously-printed layer while positioning the extrusion nozzlerelative to the print bed to print the current object layer. Oncea layer is completed, the method 200 continues at 240 withdetermining whether or not more layers need to be printed. Ifso, the method 200 involves raising the extrusion nozzlevertically away from the print bed to a new layer height/vertical position and repeating steps 250-280. If not, themethod 200 ends at 290 such as with moving the print headaway from the printed multi-color 3D object, turning thenoZZle heater off, and indicating printing is completed (e.g.,through a user interface on a printer interface computer system).0034. While the specific implementation of the 3D printermay vary to practice the invention, it may be useful to provideone exemplary configuration for a 3D printer that may operateto print multi-colored 3D objects with a single print head andwith a single print material supply. FIGS. 3-6 illustrate various views of a 3D printer 300 useful for multi-colored printing. The 3D printer 300 includes a frame or a housing 310upon which is a mounted a print bed or platform 314, whichmay be heated so as to minimize curling of the plastic duringcooling/printing (e.g., for use with ABS plastic). The 3DDec. 31, 2015printer includes a print head assembly 320 with a print head324 and with a mounting and positioning assembly 322. The3D printer 300 may include a motherboard for receiving 3Dmodel data from a computer via a USB or similar communications port for from a memory card/device and for sendingthis data to controllers.0035) Specifically, the 3D printer 300 may include drivemotors to control motion of the print head 324 with assembly322 (or by movement of the build platform 314 in somealternative embodiments). For example, a Z-axis motor maybe provided to raise and lower the print head 324 in thevertical direction relative to the upper surface of the buildplatform 314 and also include X-axis and Y-axis motors tomove the print head 324 side-to-side and front-to-back relative to the build platform 314 and previously printed layers ofa 3D object on the platform 314. Stepper motor controllersmay be included to translate commands from the controlleron the motherboard into pulses to precisely move the steppermotors and accurately position the print head 324.0036. The printer head 324 includes a heater on a mixingchamber or extrusion end 330 along with a print nozzle 334.Print material is provided with a spool 340 mounted onto theframe 310 to be able to spin or rotate, and a length or amount342 of plastic filament 344 is wound onto the spool. Asdiscussed above, the plastic filament 344 is a neutral colorSuch as white or clear/translucent that can easily be coloredfor printing portions of a 3D objects shell. The print headassembly 320 may include a stepper motor to draw in theplastic filament 344 into a tube 336 upstream of the outlet/nozzle 334, and the heater of the extrusion end 330 may heatthe drawn or fed in filament 344 to a predefined temperaturerange to liquefy or melt it. For example, a cartridge may beused to apply heat to a metal core that melts the filament/plastic 344, and the core may be wrapped in insulation.0037. The melted plastic is then pushed through the nozzle334 in a thin stream so as to buildup the 3D object on the buildplatform 314 in layers (e.g., each layer may be about 0.3millimeters thick). Prior to extrusion, though, the melted plastic may be dyed or colored with one or more inks to providea printed, multi-colored 3D object on the build platform 314.To this end, the 3D printer 300 includes an ink supply assembly 350 with first, second, and third ink cartridges or tanks352,354,356 that are each filled with a different color of ink(e.g., red, green, and blue ink). The printer head assembly 320(or the cartridges themselves) is adapted to selectively drawvolumes of the ink through the feed or supply lines (tubes)353,355,357, which lead from the cartridges 352,354,356 toinlet ports or an ink input/inlet adapter 338 on the mixingchamber or extrusion end 330 of the printer head 324. In thismanner, the melted plastic is printed out in its base, neutralcolor or is first colored to be one of the colors of the ink in oneof the cartridges 352,354,356 or a color obtained by mixingthe same or differing quantities of two or more of the inks.0038 Although the invention has been described and illustrated with a certain degree of particularity, it is understoodthat the present disclosure has been made only by way ofexample, and that numerous changes in the combination andarrangement of parts can be resorted to by those skilled in theart without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, as hereinafter claimed.0039. The ink tanks or cartridges provided on the 3Dprinter may be used to provide ink of one, two, or more colors.One embodiment selectively provides ink that is red, green,blue or a mixture of these colored inks with a separate blackUS 2015/0375451 A1ink cartridge in Some embodiments. In another case, theCMYK color model is used, and the 3D printer includes fourink tanks/cartridges providing four colors of ink: cyan,magenta, yellow, and black. These four colors can then beused independently to provide liquid plastic of one of thesefour colors or mixed in numerous combinations to provideliquid plastic with a wide variety of colors. The ink should beselected for its compatibility with the particular plastic (ABS,PTA, or the like) used in the 3D printer. For example, the inkmay be an aqueous ink, a solvent ink, a UV-curable ink, a dyeSublimination ink, or other plastic-coloring ink or dye.0040. The 3D printer may be designed to build upon theFused Filament Fabrication (FFF) method. Particularly, a 3Ddesign of an object, including full color definitions or mapping of object elements (or at least their outer Surfaces),which can be used to print liquefied plastic that has beencolored to match the definitions/mapping in each print layer(or at least in each layer's shell). The controller and/or software of the 3D printer translate the 3D design into instructions for the 3D printer. The 3D printer then heats the neutralcolored filament, mixes it withink(s) selected based on colormapping/definitions of the 3D design of the object, andextrudes it out through a nozzle on a surface to build a 3Dobject colored layer-by-colored layer (with the surfaceoptionally being heated to control cooling and Subsequentshrinking of lower layers). The neutral-colored filament maybe fed to the print head (e.g., into the print heads extruder) viaguide tubes in some embodiments of the 3D printer.We claim:1.
