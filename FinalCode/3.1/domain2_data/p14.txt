BACKGROUND
Technical Field
[ 0002 ] This disclosure relates in general to three dimen
sional ( “ 3D ” ) printers having a configuration that prepares a
three - dimensional object by using a feedstock comprising a
metal or a polymer compound and a carbon coating formed
on a surface of the compound . This disclosure also relates to
such feedstocks and their preparation methods . This disclo
sure further relates to 3D composite objects prepared by using such printers and feedstocks . This disclosure also
relates to carbon containing photocurable formulations and
methods for their preparation . This disclosure further relates

Description of Related Art
[ 0003 ] 3D printing , also known as additive manufacturing , is a technology of building three dimensional ( 3D ) solid
objects by depositing layers of materials in a design defined
by a computer software using many of the commonly available CAD ( computer aided design ) packages . This
technology can create highly customized complex parts and
products that are difficult or impossible to manufacture using traditional technologies . [ 0004 ] There are several major 3D printing technologies differing mainly in the way layers are built to create the final
3D object . Some methods use melting or softening materials
to produce the layers . For example , Selective Laser Sinter
ing ( SLS ) and Selective Laser Melting ( SLM ) work by respectively sintering or melting metal , plastic , ceramic , or
glass powders using irradiative heating . The heating is done
by various light sources emitting electromagnetic radiation
in ultraviolet ( UV ) , visible , or infrared ( IR ) range that is
absorbed by the powder , and the radiation energy is con
verted to heat . Typically , the light source is a lamp or a laser . For example , metal powders are typically heated by fiber
lasers emitting IR radiation . For example , the popular M 400
SLS 3D printer manufactured by EOS ( Germany ) uses a
Yb - fiber laser rated at about 1 kilowatt power operating at
about 1 , 070 nanometer wavelength . The second group of
methods , exemplified by Fused Deposition Modeling ( FDM ) , works by extruding melted plastic filaments or
metal wires through an extrusion nozzle . The third group of
methods such as stereolithography ( SLA ) and Digital Light Processing ( DLP ) are based on curing ( solidifying ) liquid materials ( such as photopolymer resins ) with electromag netic radiation in UV , visible , or IR ranges . Typically , SLA
lasers require much less power compared to SLS lasers . For
example , the popular Form1 + 3D printer manufactured by
Formlabs ( Somerville , Mass . ) uses a 0 . 12 watt laser oper ating at about 405 nanometer wavelength . [ 0005 ] Current challenges include improving the available
3D printing materials to impart advanced properties and
versatility needed for industrial applications , as well as
enabling faster 3D printing processes . [ 0006 ] For further disclosures related to the nanocarbon

[ 0007 ] A variety of CNT materials ( i . e . , single - wall , double - wall , and multi - wall CNTs ) are commercially avail
able as dry powders and / or suspensions . These CNT mate
rials may be synthesized by variety of CNT synthesis
methods . Some examples of the CNT synthesis methods are
arc - discharge methods , laser - vaporization methods , and
chemical vapor deposition method ( CVD ) . See , for example , following publications : M . Kumar and Y . Ando , Chemical

these publications is incorporated herein by reference . 10008 ] The arc - discharge method employs evaporation of
metal - catalyzed graphite electrodes in electric arcs that
involve very high ( about 4 , 000° C . ) temperatures . The
laser - vaporization method employs evaporation of graphite
target by lasers in conjunction with high - temperature fur
naces . These two methods operate in a batch mode and may therefore be poorly suited to high - volume , low cost produc tion . The CVD method is based on decomposition of carbon
containing gases on supported catalyst and may offer the
more efficient , low - cost , and scalable method of producing
CNTs . Currently , most commercial CNT materials are
manufactured by the CVD method . [ 0009 ] For examples of 3D printers and 3D printing tech

SUMMARY
[ 0010 ] This disclosure relates in general to three dimen sional ( “ “ 3D ' ' ) printers having a configuration that prepares
three - dimensional objects by using a feedstock comprising a
metal or a polymer compound and a carbon coating formed
on a surface of the compound . This disclosure also relates to
such feedstocks and their preparation methods . This disclo
sure further relates to 3D composite objects prepared by
using such printers and feedstocks . This disclosure also
relates to carbon containing photocurable formulations and
methods for their preparation . This disclosure further relates
to electrically conducting 3D polymer composites prepared
by using such carbon containing photocurable formulations . [ 0011 ] This disclosure relates to a 3D printer that may have a configuration that dispenses a feedstock ; deposits a
layer of the feedstock on a surface ; delivers an electromag
netic radiation to selected areas of the feedstock layer ; and
prepares a three - dimensional object . The coating may
absorb the delivered electromagnetic radiation at a selected
area of the feedstock layer , convert the absorbed electro
magnetic radiation to heat , and transfer the heat to the metal
compound thereby heating the selected area of the feedstock
layer , and causing the feedstock to bond to each other , and
thereby forming a bonded feedstock layer . [ 0012 ] The 3D printer may further have a configuration that deposits a layer of feedstock on a surface of the bonded
feedstock layer formed before ; and forms another bonded
feedstock layer . Thus , the 3D printer of the instant disclosure
may prepare an object layer by layer . [ 0013 ] This disclosure also relates to a feedstock . The feedstock may comprise a compound and a coating formed
on a surface of the compound . The compound may be any compound . For example , the compound may be a metal , a
glass , a ceramic , a polymer , or a combination thereof . For
example , the compound may be a metal . [ 0014 ] . This disclosure also relates to carbon containing photocurable formulations and methods for their preparation and to electrically conducting 3D polymer composites pre
pared by using such carbon containing photocurable formu
lations . Addition of carbons to photocurable formulations
may impart high electrically conductivity and also improve mechanical , thermal , and other properties of 3D - printed polymer objects . For example , carbon containing polymer
composites may have higher tensile strength and be less
flammable compared to pristine polymer objects . 10015 ] The coating may comprise a carbon . The carbon
may be any type of carbon . For example , the carbon may comprise a nanocarbon , a pyrolytic carbon , a graphite , an
activated carbon , an amorphous carbon , a carbon fiber , or a
combination thereof . For example , the coating may com
prise a nanocarbon . The nanocarbon may be a non - agglom
erated nanocarbon . Examples of the nanocarbon may be a
carbon nanotube ( CNT ) , a graphene ( GR ) , a fullerene ( FL ) , or a combination thereof . Examples of the carbon nanotube
may be a single - wall carbon nanotube , a double - wall carbon
nanotube , a multi - wall carbon nanotube , or a combination
thereof . For example , the coating may comprise a graphene . Examples of the graphene may be a single layer graphene ,
a double layer graphene , a multilayer graphene , a graphene strip , or a combination thereof . For example , the coating
may comprise a fullerene . Examples the fullerene may be a
C60 , a C70 , a C76 , a C78 , a C84 , or a combination thereof . [ 0016 ] For example , the compound may comprise a metal . The metal compound may be any metal . The examples of the
metal compound may be titanium , vanadium , chromium ,
manganese , iron , cobalt , nickel , copper , zinc , ruthenium , rhodium , palladium , aluminum , indium , gallium , tin , silver , gold , platinum , lead , bismuth , steel , bronze , brass , or a
combination thereof . The metal compound may have any shape . For example , the metal compound may comprise a
metal particle ( e . g . granule ) , a metal wire , a metal tube , a
metal sheet , or a combination thereof . [ 0017 ] The coating may absorb the delivered electromag
netic radiation at a selected area of the feedstock layer , may
convert the absorbed electromagnetic radiation to heat , and
may then transfer the heat to the compound thereby heating
the selected area of the feedstock layer , and causing the
feedstock to bond to each other , and thereby forming a
bonded feedstock layer . [ 0018 ] The coating has an absorbance of the electromag netic radiation . The absorbance of the coating may be higher
than absorbance of the compound . For example , the absor
bance of the coating may be at least 50 percent , at least 100
percent , at least 500 percent , or at least 800 percent higher
than the absorbance of the compound . [ 0019 ] Because the coating has an absorbance of the
electromagnetic radiation higher than that of the compound , heating rate of the feedstock comprising the compound and
the coating may be higher than that of a feedstock without
the coating . For example , the heating rate of the feedstock
comprising the compound and the coating may be at least 50
percent , at least 100 percent , at least 500 percent , or at least
800 percent higher than that of a feedstock without the
coating .
[ 0020 ] The 3D printer of the instant disclosure may emit
the electromagnetic radiation at any power suitable to form
a bonded feedstock layer . For example , the 3D printer may 
US 2017 / 0297262 A1 Oct . 19 , 2017
emit the electromagnetic radiation with power less than or
equivalent to 5 , 000 watts , with power less than or equivalent
to 1 , 000 watts ; with power less than or equivalent to 500
watts ; or with power less than or equivalent to 100 watts . ( 0021 ] A three - dimensional object prepared by any of the
3D printers disclosed above may be within scope of this
instant disclosure . [ 0022 ] This disclosure also relates to a feedstock as dis
closed above . This feedstock may be used for preparation of
3D objects by any equipment or method . For example , this
feedstock may be used for preparation of 3D objects by any
of the 3D printers disclosed above . [ 0023 ] . The feedstock may comprise a compound , and a
coating formed on a surface of the compound . [ 0024 ] The compound may be any compound . For
example , the compound may comprise a metal , a glass , a
ceramic , a polymer , or a combination thereof . For example , the compound may comprise a metal . For example , the
compound may comprise a polymer . [ 0025 ] The coating may comprise a carbon . The carbon
may be any type of carbon . For example , the carbon may comprise a nanocarbon , a pyrolytic carbon , a graphite , an
activated carbon , an amorphous carbon , a carbon fiber , or a
combination thereof . For example , the coating may com
prise a nanocarbon . The nanocarbon may be a non - agglom
erated nanocarbon . Examples of the nanocarbon may be a
carbon nanotube ( CNT ) , a graphene ( GR ) , a fullerene ( FL ) ,
or a combination thereof . Examples of the carbon nanotube
may be a single - wall carbon nanotube , a double - wall carbon
nanotube , a multi - wall carbon nanotube , or a combination
thereof . For example , the coating may comprise a graphene . Examples of the graphene may be a single layer graphene , a double layer graphene , a multilayer graphene , a graphene strip , or a combination thereof . For example , the coating
may comprise a fullerene . Examples the fullerene may be a
C60 , a C70 , a C76 , a C78 , a C84 , or a combination thereof . [ 0026 ] For example , the compound may be a metal . The
metal may be any metal . The examples of the metal com
pound may comprise titanium , vanadium , chromium , man
ganese , iron , cobalt , nickel , copper , zinc , ruthenium , rho
dium , palladium , aluminum , indium , gallium , tin , silver , gold , platinum , lead , bismuth , steel , bronze , brass , or a
combination thereof . The metal compound may have any
shape . For example , the metal compound may comprise a
metal particle ( e . g . granule ) , a metal wire , a metal tube , a
metal sheet , or a combination thereof . 100271 The coating has an absorbance of the electromag netic radiation . The absorbance of the coating may be higher
than absorbance of the compound . For example , the absor
bance of the coating may be at least 50 percent , at least 100
percent , at least 500 percent , or at least 800 percent higher
than the absorbance of the compound . [ 0028 ] Because the coating has an absorbance of the
electromagnetic radiation higher than that of the compound , heating rate of the feedstock comprising the compound and
the coating may be higher than that of a feedstock without
the coating . For example , the heating rate of the feedstock
comprising the compound and the coating may be at least 50
percent , at least 100 percent , at least 500 percent , or at least
800 percent higher than that of a feedstock without the
coating . [ 0029 ] The coating may be sufficiently thick to substan
tially absorb electromagnetic radiation , but not too thick to
cause defects in the composite object and thereby negatively
impact properties of the composite object . For example , the
coating thickness may be in the range of 10 nanometers to
100 micrometers , in the range of 100 nanometers to 10
micrometers , or in the range of 1 micrometer to 5 microm
eters . 100301 A three - dimensional object prepared by using any
of the feedstocks disclosed above may be within scope of
this instant disclosure . 10031 ] The instant disclosure also relates to a method of
preparation ( preparation method ” ) . For example , the prepa ration method may be preparation of a suspension of a
carbon in a solvent ( “ method of preparation of a carbon
suspension " ) . For example , the method may comprise pro
cessing a conditioned mixture at a high shear rate and
thereby preparing a carbon suspension . In this preparation method , the conditioned mixture may be prepared by a
method comprising processing a solution at a low shear rate . The low shear rate may be lower than 200 , 000 s - 4 . The high shear rate may be equivalent to or higher than 200 , 000 s - 1 . ( 0032 ] In this method , first , the conditioned mixture may be prepared . The conditioned mixture may be prepared by processing a solution at a shear rate lower than 200 , 000 s - 7 . In this method , second , a carbon suspension is prepared by
processing the conditioned mixture at a shear rate higher
than 200 , 000 s - 1 . After this high shear processing , a carbon
suspension comprising substantially non - agglomerated car
bons may be obtained . [ 0033 ] The solution may comprise a carbon and a solvent . The solution may be substantially free of any dispersing
agent . The carbon may be substantially free of functional
groups that can facilitate dispersion of the carbon in the
solution . [ 0034 ] The carbon may be any carbon disclosed above . For example , the carbon may comprise a nanocarbon , a

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE
EMBODIMENTS
[ 0070 ] Illustrative embodiments are now described . Other
embodiments may be used in addition or instead . Details that
may be apparent or unnecessary may be omitted to save
space or for a more effective presentation . Some embodi
ments may be practiced with additional components or steps
and / or without all of the components or steps that are
described . 10071 ] In this disclosure , the word “ form ” may mean
“ deposit ” , “ coat ” , “ dispose ” , “ laminate ” , “ apply ” , “ place ” , " provide ” , “ position ” , “ manufacture ” or the like . In this
disclosure , the phrase " any combination thereof " or " a
combination thereof ” may mean “ a mixture thereof " , " a
composite thereof ” , “ an alloy thereof ” , or the like . In this
disclosure , the indefinite article “ a ” and phrases “ one or
more ” and “ at least one ” are synonymous and mean “ at least
one ” . 10072 ] This disclosure relates in general to three dimen
sional ( “ 3D ” ) printers having a configuration that prepares
three - dimensional objects by using a feedstock comprising a
metal or a polymer compound and a carbon coating formed
on a surface of the compound . This disclosure also relates to
such feedstocks and their preparation methods . This disclo
sure further relates to 3D composite objects prepared by
using such printers and feedstocks . This disclosure also
relates to carbon containing photocurable formulations and
methods for their preparation . This disclosure further relates
to electrically conducting 3D polymer composites prepared
by using such carbon containing photocurable formulations .
[ 0073 ] Addition of carbons and , in particular , nanocar
bons , such as carbon nanotubes ( CNT ) , graphenes ( GR ) , fullerenes ( FL ) , and their mixtures in various proportions and combinations , to metal , plastic , ceramic , glass , polymer , and other 3D printing materials may lead to formation of
nanocarbon composites with increased electrical conductiv
ity , increased thermal conductivity , increased mechanical
strength , and other improvements in properties . [ 0074 ] Addition of nanocarbons also may lead to
increased absorption of incident light in wide frequency
range ( e . g . , UV , visible , IR ) thereby improving the efficiency
of irradiative heating of the feedstock and photochemical reactions . This may lead to higher rates and increased
throughput of 3D printing processes , thereby making 3D
printed parts more competitive on the market . [ 0075 ] A major challenge in these tasks is ensuring high
degree of dispersion of carbon in the carbon composite
materials since only well - dispersed carbons impart useful
properties . Typically , carbon agglomeration results in under
utilized potential of the composite material and degraded properties of product . [ 0076 ] Another challenge is preventing structural or other
damage to carbons in the process of fabrication of nanocar
bon composites . Damaged carbons may exhibit inferior
properties when incorporated in composite materials .

[ 0077 ] The feedstock of the instant disclosure may provide several advantages to the 3D printing of objects . For
example , three dimensional objects may be printed at higher throughputs by using the feedstocks of the instant disclo
sure . The production costs of such article may thereby be
decreased while production rates are increased . The use of
these feedstocks may also decrease the power requirements of the 3D printers , thereby decreasing the prices of such
printers . 10078 ] . The feedstocks of the instant disclosure may also
provide materials with improved properties for 3D printing
technologies . These improvements may include ( but not
limited to ) higher electrical and thermal conductivity , better
mechanical and thermal properties . [ 0079 ] This disclosure relates to a 3D printer that may have a configuration that dispenses a feedstock ; deposits a
layer of the feedstock on a surface ; delivers an electromag netic radiation to selected areas of the feedstock layer ; and
prepares a three - dimensional object . The coating may
absorb the delivered electromagnetic radiation at a selected
area of the feedstock layer , convert the absorbed electro
magnetic radiation to heat , and transfer the heat to the metal
compound thereby heating the selected area of the feedstock
layer , and causing the feedstock to bond to each other , and
thereby forming a bonded feedstock layer . [ 0080 ] The deposition of the first layer may happen on any
surface . For example , this surface may be a surface of
another object . [ 0081 ] The 3D printer may further have a configuration that deposits a layer of feedstock on a surface of the bonded
feedstock layer formed before ; and forms another bonded
feedstock layer . Thus , the 3D printer of the instant disclosure
may prepare an object layer by layer .
[ 0082 ] This disclosure also relates to a feedstock . The
feedstock may comprise a compound and a coating formed
on a surface of the compound . The compound may comprise
any compound . For example , the compound may comprise
a metal , a glass , a ceramic , a polymer , or a combination
thereof . For example , the compound may be a metal . For
example , the compound may be a polymer . [ 0083 ] The coating may comprise a carbon . The carbon
may be any type of carbon . For example , the carbon may comprise a nanocarbon , a pyrolytic carbon , a graphite , an
activated carbon , an amorphous carbon , a carbon fiber , or a
combination thereof . [ 0084 ] For example , the coating may comprise a nanocar
bon . The nanocarbon may be a non - agglomerated nanocar
bon . Examples of the nanocarbon may be a carbon nanotube
( CNT ) , a graphene ( GR ) , a fullerene ( FL ) , or a combination
thereof . Examples of the carbon nanotube may be a single wall carbon nanotube , a double - wall carbon nanotube , a
multi - wall carbon nanotube , or a combination thereof . [ 0085 ] For example , the coating may comprise a graphene . Examples of the graphene may be a single layer graphene , a double layer graphene , a multilayer graphene , a graphene
strip , or a combination thereof . [ 0086 ] For example , the coating may comprise a fullerene . Examples the fullerene may be a C60 , a C70 , a C76 , a C78 , a
C84 , or a combination thereof . [ 0087 ] For example , the compound may be a metal com

examples of the metal compound may be titanium , vana
dium , chromium , manganese , iron , cobalt , nickel , copper , zinc , ruthenium , rhodium , palladium , aluminum , indium ,
gallium , tin , silver , gold , platinum , lead , bismuth , steel , bronze , brass , or a combination thereof . [ 0088 ] The metal compound may have any shape . For
example , the metal compound may comprise a metal particle ( e . g . granule ) , a metal wire , a metal tube , a metal sheet , or
a combination thereof . [ 0089 ] The coating may absorb the delivered electromag netic radiation at a selected area of the feedstock layer , may convert the absorbed electromagnetic radiation to heat , and
may then transfer the heat to the compound thereby heating the selected area of the feedstock layer , and causing the
feedstock to bond to each other , and thereby forming a
bonded feedstock layer . [ 0090 ] The coating has an absorbance of the electromag netic radiation . The absorbance of the coating may be higher
than absorbance of the compound . For example , the absor
bance of the coating may be at least 50 percent , at least 100
percent , at least 500 percent , or at least 800 percent higher
than the absorbance of the compound .
[ 0091 ] Because the coating has an absorbance of the
electromagnetic radiation higher than that of the compound ,
heating rate of the feedstock comprising the compound and
the coating may be higher than that of a feedstock without
the coating . For example , the heating rate of the feedstock
comprising the compound and the coating may be at least 50
percent , at least 100 percent , at least 500 percent , or at least
800 percent higher than that of a feedstock without the
coating . [ 0092 ] The coating may be sufficiently thick to substan
tially absorb electromagnetic radiation , but not too thick to
cause defects in the composite object and thereby negatively impact properties of the composite object . For example , the
coating thickness may be in the range of 10 nanometers to
100 micrometers , in the range of 100 nanometers to 10
micrometers , or in the range of 1 micrometer to 5 microm
eters . 10093 ] . The 3D printer of the instant disclosure may emit
the electromagnetic radiation at any power suitable to form
a bonded feedstock layer . Lowest emission power that forms
a bonded feedstock layer may be preferred since manufac
turing cost of the 3D printers and / or operating costs of such
printers may thereby be decreased . For example , the 3D
printer may emit the electromagnetic radiation with power less than or equivalent to 5 , 000 watts , with power less than
or equivalent to 1 , 000 watts ; with power less than or
equivalent to 500 watts ; or with power less than or equiva
lent to 100 watts . [ 0094 ] Any three - dimensional object prepared by any of

instant disclosure . [ 0095 ] This disclosure also relates to a feedstock as dis
closed above . This feedstock may be used in preparation of

ceramic , a polymer , or a combination thereof . For example , the compound may comprise a metal . For example , the
compound may comprise a polymer . [ 0098 ] The coating may comprise a carbon . The carbon
may be any type of carbon . For example , the carbon may

comprise a nanocarbon , a pyrolytic carbon , a graphite , an
activated carbon , an amorphous carbon , a carbon fiber , or a
combination thereof .
[ 0099 ] For example , the coating may comprise a nanocar
bon . The nanocarbon may be a non - agglomerated nanocar
bon . Examples of the nanocarbon may be a carbon nanotube
( CNT ) , a graphene ( GR ) , a fullerene ( FL ) , or a combination
thereof . Examples of the carbon nanotube may be a single
wall carbon nanotube , a double - wall carbon nanotube , a
multi - wall carbon nanotube , or a combination thereof . [ 0100 ] For example , the coating may comprise a graphene . Examples of the graphene may be a single layer graphene , a double layer graphene , a multilayer graphene , a graphene strip , or a combination thereof . [ 0101 ] For example , the coating may comprise a fullerene . Examples the fullerene may be a C60 , a C70 , a C76 , a C78 , a
C84 , or a combination thereof . 10102 ] For example , the compound may be a metal . The
metal compound may comprise any metal . The examples of
the metal may comprise titanium , vanadium , chromium , manganese , iron , cobalt , nickel , copper , zinc , ruthenium , rhodium , palladium , aluminum , indium , gallium , tin , silver , gold , platinum , lead , bismuth , steel , bronze , brass , or a
combination thereof . [ 0103 ] The metal compound may have any shape . For

( e . g . granule ) , a metal wire , a metal tube , a metal sheet , or
a combination thereof . [ 0104 ] The coating may have an absorbance of the elec
tromagnetic radiation . The absorbance of the coating may be
higher than absorbance of the compound . For example , the
absorbance of the coating may be at least 50 percent , at least
100 percent , at least 500 percent , or at least 800 percent higher than the absorbance of the compound . [ 0105 ] Because the coating has an absorbance of the
electromagnetic radiation higher than that of the compound , heating rate of the feedstock comprising the compound and
the coating may be higher than that of a feedstock without
the coating . For example , the heating rate of the feedstock
comprising the compound and the coating may be at least 50
percent , at least 100 percent , at least 500 percent , or at least
800 percent higher than that of a feedstock without the
coating .
[ 0106 ] The coating may be sufficiently thick to substan
tially absorb electromagnetic radiation , but not too thick to
cause defects in the composite object and thereby negatively impact properties of the composite object . For example , the
coating thickness may be in the range of 10 nanometers to
100 micrometers , in the range of 100 nanometers to 10

[ 0135 ] In this preparation method the carbon may com
prise a carbon nanotube . The carbon nanotube may comprise
a single - wall carbon nanotube , a double - wall carbon nano
tube , a multi - wall carbon nanotube , or a combination
thereof . The carbon containing photocurable formulation , when cured , may yield a polymer composite with an elec
trical resistivity lower than or equivalent to 1 ohm . cm . [ 0136 ] Any three - dimensional polymer composite object prepared by using any of the carbon containing photocurable formulation disclosed above , which may be prepared by any of the methods suitable for preparation of such formulations
may be within the scope of the instant disclosure . [ 0137 ) As disclosed above , the CNT materials may be
synthesized by variety of CNT synthesis methods . The CNT
formation and growth may stop during the synthesis . The
CNT formation and growth may stop due to decreased
catalyst activity when the catalyst ' s surface is covered with
an amorphous carbon layer . Or , the CNT formation and
growth may be stopped after a pre - determined period of
synthesis . At this process stage , the CNTs are “ as - synthe sized CNTs ” . [ 0138 ] The as - synthesized CNTs may be processed before
they are used . For example , the as - synthesized CNTs may be
incorporated into a liquid or mixed with a liquid . This
incorporation may be done , for example , to dissolve impu rities ( e . g . non - CNT material ) , to provide a CNT suspension ,
or a combination thereof . Examples of impurities may be
non - CNT carbons ( e . g . , amorphous carbon ) , inorganic cata
lysts , catalyst supports , or a combination thereof . 10139 ] The liquid mixture at this process stage may com
prise a liquid and an as - synthesized nanocarbon ( “ the nano
carbon slurry ” ) . The liquid may comprise any liquid . For
example , the liquid may comprise water , or mixtures
thereof . The solvent may comprise any solvent . For
example , the solvent may comprise a hydrocarbon solvent
such as alcohol , ketone , ester , ether , alkane , alkene , aromatic
hydrocarbons ( such as benzene and various derivatives ) , or
mixtures thereof . The nanocarbon slurry may further com
prise an acid , a base , a suspension agent , or a combination
thereof . [ 0140 ] In one example , the CVD process may involve
passing a hydrocarbon vapor through a reactor at a suffi
ciently high temperature , varying in the range of 600° C . to 1200° C . , and in presence of a catalyst to decompose the
hydrocarbon . In one example , the catalyst may comprise
metals and / or metal oxides ( e . g . , Fe , Co , Ni , Mo , their
oxides , and a combination thereof ) . The catalyst may be
nanoparticles of such metals and / or metal oxides . In one
example , support material may comprise alumina , silica , magnesium oxide , and a combination thereof . The CNTs
may form and grow on catalyst particles in the reactor and
may be collected upon cooling the system to a room tem
perature . These CNTs collected directly from the reactor and
not yet treated in any way are the as - synthesized CNTs . The
as - synthesized CNTs may comprise at least 50 wt % inor
ganic impurities including the catalyst and the support
material , which may need to be removed to produce a
material comprising CNTs with desired properties . 10141 ] In one example , the as - synthesized CNTs may be
purified by being immersed in acids ( such as H2SO4 , HNO3 , HCl , and a combination thereof ) and refluxed for a period
varying in the range of 1 hour to 24 hours resulting in
significantly decreased amount of impurities ( down to a few
wt % of impurities ) . The purified CNT material may be
thoroughly washed to remove any residual acid and then
dried in a convection oven at a temperature varying in the
range of 20° C . to 150° C . for a period varying in the range of 1 hour to 48 hours . [ 0142 ] The as - synthesized and purified CNTs may easily be dispersed in the liquid since they may not be substantially
agglomerated . However , upon being wetted and subse
quently dried , the CNT material may be converted into an
agglomerated and tangled mat comprising irregular clusters
of individual CNTs , as shown in FIG . 1 . This post - drying transition may occur due to high amount of the CNTs '
atomically smooth surface and attendant large surface
energy . This condition may make the conformation of
straight individual CNTs energetically unstable and suscep tible to deformation and agglomeration . [ 0143 ] The instability may greatly be enhanced by intro
ducing a liquid between individual CNTs and then evapo rating the liquid . In other words , wetting and then drying
CNTs may induce severe agglomeration due to attraction
forces exerted by liquids in intimate contact with the CNT
surface . Upon drying , CNTs may coalesce into large bundles
( including tens to hundreds of CNTs in cross section ) , which
then form a highly tangled structure , as shown in FIG . 1 by
way of example . These agglomerated structures may not
exhibit many of the remarkable properties expected of
individual , well - dispersed and / or isolated CNTs . 10144 ] Commercially available CNT materials are typi
cally those of the purified and dried grade , marketed either
as a powder obtained after drying , or as a CNT suspension produced by re - dispersing the dry purified powder in either
an aqueous or organic solvent . The commercially available
purified grades of the CNT materials ( “ the commercial
CNTs ” ) may undergo at least one wetting and drying cycle
before they are supplied to a user . The commercial CNTs
may thereby have agglomerated structures . [ 0145 ] It may then be difficult to disperse this agglomer ated structure down to the level of individual CNTs that may be required for many applications . To accomplish this task , commercially available grades of CNT materials may have
to be subjected to vigorous harsh treatments that may
consume a lot of energy and inflict considerable collateral
damage upon the CNT material ( e . g . , by destroying some
CNTs , creating defects in CNT walls , and / or cutting CNTs
into shorter segments ) resulting in degraded nanocarbon
material properties . [ 014 ] In one example , this disclosure relates to a method
comprising using the as - synthesized CNTs , the non - agglom
erated and / or non - damaged CNTs , the CNT slurry , or the
combination thereof in preparation of the nanocarbon com
posites . The drying - induced agglomeration and entangle ment , as well as damage during processing of agglomerated CNT may thereby be avoided . For example , the purified CNTs may be kept in a suspension or , at least , as the
nanocarbon slurry ( the “ purified CNT slurry ' ) . In other
words , the as - synthesized CNT materials may be purified by refluxing in acids but then never be allowed to dry before
reaching the customer , instead being kept as the purified
CNT slurry . The customer may either use the purified CNT
slurry or , if necessary , exchange the liquid with another
liquid and process the CNT slurry as desired , allowing it to
dry only at the final step of their process . This arrangement
would significantly facilitate dispersion and prevent dam
aging of CNT materials resulting in improvement of product properties and performance .

during the dispersion process . The G / D ratio of a nanocar
bon incorporated in a nanocarbon composite being 80 %
lower than , 50 % lower than , 25 % lower than , 10 % lower
than that of the as - synthesized nanocarbon may indicate a
non - damaged nanocarbon . Also , the G / D ratio of a nano
carbon incorporated in a composite being at least 80 %
higher than , at least 50 % higher than , at least 25 % higher
than , at least 10 % higher than , or at least equal to that of the
as - synthesized nanocarbon may indicate a non - damaged nanocarbon .
[ 0153 ] The disclosure is illustrated further by the follow
ing additional examples that are not to be construed as
limiting the disclosure in scope to the specific procedures or
products described in them .
EXAMPLE 1
[ 0147 ] The process of dispersing the purified CNT slurry
material down to the level of individual CNTs may be
accomplished through any of mixing , sonicating , or homog
enizing techniques , or a combination thereof . As compared
to the current commercial CNT materials , the dispersion of
the purified CNT slurry material may require much less
effort and inflict much less damage to CNTs in the process of achieving the desired degree of dispersion . The same
considerations may apply to other types of nanocarbon
materials . Higher degree of dispersion and reduced damage to nanocarbon structure may result in improved properties . The dispersion process may be carried out in either aqueous
or organic solvents . Examples of aqueous or organic sol
vents may comprise water , toluene , alcohol , carbon disul
fide , dichlorobenzene , other benzene derivatives , aromatic
solvents , dimethylformamide , N - methylpyrrolidinone , pyri
dine , and mixtures thereof . [ 0148 ] The purified CNT slurry may comprise a liquid and
a CNT . The CNT may comprise less than 80 wt % , less than
50 wt % , or less than 10 wt % of the CNT slurry . Presence
of sufficient number of liquid molecules in intimate contact
with CNTs stabilizes the system and prevents CNT agglom eration . 10149 ] A convenient method to evaluate the degree of
agglomeration of CNTs incorporated into composite mate
rials may be through examination of scanning electron
microscopy ( SEM ) and / or transmission electron microscopy
( TEM ) images . The CNT agglomerates are readily visible in
SEM and / or TEM images at magnifications 1 , 000 or 30 , 000
times and less , depending on agglomerate size . The non
agglomerated CNTs are much smaller in size and may be
seen in SEM and / or TEM images at magnifications 40 , 000
or 80 , 000 times and higher . ( 0150 ] The damage to CNTs caused by a harsh dispersion
process may be evaluated by measuring Raman spectros
copy , in particular , using the intensity ratio of the so - called
G - band and D - band . The G - bands that are typically detected
at about 1 , 580 cm - ? ( within 120 cm - ? ) are due to the
non - defective graphitic CNT structure of , while the D - bands
( at about 1 , 350 cm - 1 within + 20 cm - ? ) are predominantly
due to structural defects , as disclosed by M . S . Dresselhaus , A . Jorio , A . G . Souza Filho and R . Saito , Defect character
ization in graphene and carbon nanotubes using Raman
spectroscopy , Phil . Trans . Royal Society A , vol . 368 , pp . 5355 - 5377 ( 2010 ) . The content of this publication is incor
porated herein by reference . [ 0151 ] The intensity ratio of the G - band to the D - band
( i . e . , the G / D ratio ) may be used as a measure of relative
concentration of CNT defects . Similar evaluation process based on G / D ratio maybe used for graphene materials , as
disclosed by A . C . Ferrari , Raman spectroscopy of graphene
and graphite : Disorder , electron — phonon coupling , doping
and nonadiabatic effects , Solid State Communications , vol . 143 , pp . 47 - 57 ( 2007 ) . The content of this publication is
incorporated herein by reference . [ 0152 ] To evaluate the damage inflicted on CNT wall
structure in the process of dispersing the CNT material , the
G / D ratio may be measured and compared before and after
the dispersion process . The comparison may be done using
the same measurement conditions . The as - synthesized and
or the purified CNT slurry may have the same or higher G / D
ratio after the dispersion , while the agglomerated CNTs
( e . g . , dry powder ) may have decreased G / D ratio after the
dispersion due to the damage inflicted on CNT material
[ 0154 ] As - synthesized multi - wall CNT material ( compris ing about 85 wt % inorganic impurities ) was refluxed in
excess amount of about 1M HCl for about 5 hours , and then
filtered to remove the main volume of the acid while keeping the CNT material wet . The purified product ( comprising about 2 wt % inorganic impurities ) was washed two times
with de - ionized water to remove the residual acid , and then
separated into three parts for the experiments described in
other Examples . The first part was dried in a convection
oven at about 120° C . for about 4 hours . The second part was
kept wet and refluxed in water ( at CNT concentration of
about 2 g / L ) for about 5 hours to loosen up the CNTs . The
third part was washed with copious amounts of toluene three
times thereby substantially replacing the water with toluene
as a solvent and bringing the CNT concentration to about 2
g / L . Then , the CNT - toluene suspension was refluxed for
about 5 hours . Finally , both these CNT suspensions ( one in
water and one in toluene ) were separately passed 2 times
through a Microfluidizer high shear fluid processor ( LM - 10 , Microfluidics Corporation , Newton , Mass . ) at 20 , 000 psi
pressure yielding two suspensions of non - agglomerated and /
or non - damaged CNTs . These suspensions were stable over
the period of 4 weeks . The G / D ratio as measured with about
532 nm laser excitation varied in the range of 1 . 2 to 1 . 6 , both
before and after dispersion indicating that the concentration
of structural defects did not change . All the above treatment
steps are scalable and highly reproducible .
EXAMPLE 2
[ 0155 ] Dried powder of purified multi - wall CNT material
prepared in Example 1 as the first part was dispersed following exactly the same process as the other two parts . To
produce a stable CNT suspension , the dry powder was first
refluxed in water at CNT concentration of about 2 g / L for
about 5 hours , then passed 2 times through the Microfluid
izer . The G / D ratio for the multi - wall CNT dry powder
material as measured with about 532 nm laser excitation
may vary in the range of 1 . 1 to 1 . 4 . After dispersing , the G / D
ratio decreased to a level varying in the range of 0 . 4 to 0 . 8
indicating increased concentration of CNT defects . [ 0156 ] The multi - wall CNT material may be provided , for
example , by Thomas Swan & Co Ltd ( UK ) , Nanocyl ( Bel
gium ) , or many other suppliers . The step of Microfluidizer
treatment may be combined or substituted with any high shear mixing , sonication , wet ball milling , another similar
treatment , or a combination thereof . Similar simple and 
US 2017 / 0297262 A1 Oct . 19 , 2017
efficient process may be designed to produce the as - synthe sized or the purified non - agglomerated and / or non - damaged CNT slurries . [ 0157 ] A highly dispersed and stable suspension of non
agglomerated and / or non - damaged CNT material ( “ the well
dispersed CNT suspension " ) in either water or organic solvents is thereby obtained . The well - dispersed CNT sus
pension may be used in preparation of composites suitable
for the 3D printing . [ 0158 ] In the case of SLS and FDM technologies that use
metal or plastic powder as feedstock , there is a technical
challenge of mixing nanocarbons with metal or plastic powders in a way that prevents nanocarbons from becoming
airborne , and also affords achieving the desired proportions . Dry nanocarbon is comprised of particles that may be small
( - mm or less in length , width , thickness , and / or specific
dimension ) and have relatively low density ( varying in the
range of 0 . 005 g / cc to 0 . 5 g / cc ) . These lightweight nano
carbon particles may easily get airborne thereby presenting potential health hazard and affecting the nominal nanocar
bon - to - metal or nanocarbon - to - plastic ratio . [ 0159 ] This problem is solved by devising a process to
physically attach the lightweight nanocarbon particles to
surfaces of metal or plastic particles which may be denser
and easier to feed . This step is carried out prior to feeding the
particles into the 3D printer , so that the feedstock may comprise a metal or plastic core coated with a nanocarbon
shell , as shown in FIG . 2 . [ 0160 ] On practical level , nanocarbon particles may be
coated and attached to metal particles through a variety of
coating techniques using a suspension of a nanocarbon in an
either aqueous or organic solvent , such as spray coating , dip coating , spin coating , wet ball milling , etc . Process param
eters are determined by type of a nanocarbon , type of a
metal , shape and size of the particles , conditions of the
surfaces ( such as terminating functional group ) . The
strength of adhesion may need to be just sufficient to allow
the metal particles to be processed up to the sintering or
melting step without causing detachment of the coated
nanocarbons . [ 0161 ] After the sintering or melting step , the coated
nanocarbons may be captured and incorporated within the
metal matrix leading to improved properties . Incorporation of the non - agglomerated and / or non - damaged CNT into
metal structure may result in a CNT composite with
improved electrical , thermal , mechanical , and other proper ties that may be suitable for 3D - printed products . [ 0162 ] Exemplary procedures to produce CNT - coated
metal or plastic particles are described in Examples 3 - 7 , 9 - 12 , and CNT - coated filaments — in Example 8 .
EXAMPLE 4
[ 0164 ] Iron granules ( average diameter about 50 microm
eters ) were immersed into the toluene suspension of non
agglomerated and / or non - damaged CNT of Example 1 and
subjected to a modified wet ball milling process . In particu
lar , the wet iron / CNT mixture was agitated for about 30
minutes in a ball milling apparatus either with the standard
balls ( batch 1 ) , or with the standard balls removed ( batch 2 ) . Due to the repeated impacts with iron granules or the
standard balls , CNTs get attached to the metal surface . The
mixture was dried in a convection oven at about 150° C . for
about 4 hours . Alternatively , the solvent may be removed by other methods , such as centrifuging . The amount of attached
CNT was about 0 . 05 wt % and about 0 . 08 wt % in batches
1 and 2 , respectively . The average coating thickness was 2
and 3 micrometers in batches 1 and 2 , respectively . The
CNT - coated iron granules may be used as a feedstock for
SLS , SLM , and related type 3D printers . 10165 ] Other type CNTs , graphenes and / or fullerenes may also be employed in this application either alone or in
various combinations . Graphene may be present either as
graphene oxide ( which may have to be reduced back to
graphene , e . g . , through reaction with hydrazine ) or pure graphene . The described process may also be used for other
metals , such as titanium , vanadium , chromium , manganese , cobalt , nickel , copper , zinc , ruthenium , rhodium , palladium , aluminum , indium , gallium , tin , silver , gold , platinum , lead ,
bismuth , and alloys , such as steel , bronze , brass , and a
combination thereof . These nanocarbons , metals , and / or
alloys may be commercially available from many suppliers . [ 0166 ] Plastics may also be utilized in a manner described
in this example ( customized for their particular properties , e . g . , softening temperature ) . Examples of such plastics may comprise such as ABS ( acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ) , polyamide , nylon , polycarbonate , polyethylene , polypropyl
ene , polyetherimide , polyphenylsulfone , polylactic acid , and
a combination thereof . Any of those plastics may commer
cially be available from many suppliers . Metal - plastic blends may also be used . The resulting 3D printed nanocar
bon composite may exhibit improved electrical , thermal , and
mechanical properties .
EXAMPLE 5
[ 0167 ] Aluminum granules ( average diameter about 800
micrometers ) were immersed into the toluene suspension of
non - agglomerated and / or non - damaged CNT prepared in
Example 1 and agitated for about 30 minutes in a ball
milling apparatus either with the standard balls ( batch 1 ) , or
with the standard balls removed ( batch 2 ) . The mixture was
dried in a convection oven at about 150° C . for about 4
hours . The CNT - coated granules appear black and non
reflective ( FIG . 3 ( A ) ) , while pure aluminum granules appear white and shiny ( FIG . 3 ( B ) ) . The amount of attached CNT
was about 0 . 08 wt % in batch 1 and about 0 . 23 wt % in batch
2 . The average CNT coating thickness was about 1 microm
eter and about 25 micrometers in batches 1 and 2 , respec tively . The CNT - coated aluminum granules may be used as
a feedstock for SLS , SLM , and related type 3D printers .
EXAMPLE 3
[ 0163 ] Iron powder granules ( average diameter about 50
micrometers ) were immersed into the aqueous CNT suspen sion of Example 1 , agitated for about 2 hours with a
magnetic stirrer at 1 , 000 rpm , then allowed to dry in a
convection oven at about 120° C . for about 4 hours . Weight uptake by the granules yielded the amount of attached CNT
of about 0 . 06 wt % . Examination under microscope has
shown the average CNT coating thickness of 5 micrometers . The CNT - coated iron granules may be used as a feedstock
for SLS , SLM , and related type 3D printers .
EXAMPLE 6
[ 0168 ] The batch 1 CNT - coated aluminum granules of
Example 5 were used to produce alum inum - CNT composite objects and evaluate their properties . The composite objects 
US 2017 / 0297262 A1 Oct . 19 , 2017
were fabricated by melting the CNT - coated aluminum gran ules under argon atmosphere at about 750° C . for about 1
hour while stirring to homogenize the melt , then casting the
melt into a cylinder - shaped die ( 0 . 7 cm in diameter and 15
cm in height ) and cooling down to 20° C . ( FIG . 4 ) . Under
optical microscope , no defects could be observed on sur
faces of batch 1 samples ( FIG . 5 ( A ) ) , while multiple defects
were observed on batch 2 samples ( shown by the arrow in
FIG . 5 ( B ) ) . Examination with SEM at high magnification showed that these defects were due to CNT agglomerates ( FIG . 6 ) . Pure aluminum samples were prepared as reference
following exactly the same procedure but from uncoated
aluminum granules . Electrical resistivity , tensile strength , and elongation were evaluated at about 20° C . for both
CNT - containing and pure aluminum cast samples without
any further treatment of the samples . The electrical resis
tivity was measured using four probe technique , and the
tensile properties were evaluated with an Instron ( Norwood , Mass . ) Testing System . For the reference pure aluminum
sample , the electrical resistivity was about 2 . 83
microOhms . cm , tensile strength was about 142 MPa , and
elongation was about 6 % . For the CNT - containing alumi
num sample ( batch 1 ) , the electrical resistivity was about
2 . 71 microOhms : cm , tensile strength was about 165 MPa , and elongation was about 7 % . To summarize , in the alumi
num - CNT composite ( batch 1 ) , electrical resistivity was
decreased by about 4 % , tensile strength was increased by about 16 % , and elongation was increased by about 17 % , compared to the pure aluminum . Hence , the properties of the
aluminum - CNT composite were improved if there was no
agglomeration of CNT .
EXAMPLE 7
[ 0169 ] The batch 2 CNT - coated aluminum granules of
Example 5 were used to produce aluminum - CNT compos ite objects according to the procedures of Example band
evaluate their properties . For the aluminum - CNT compos
ite of batch 2 , the electrical resistivity was about 3 . 14
microOhms . cm , tensile strength was about 115 MPa , and
elongation was about 3 % . To summarize , in the aluminum
- CNT composite ( batch 2 ) , electrical resistivity was
increased by about 10 % , tensile strength was decreased by about 18 % , and elongation was decreased by about 50 % , compared to the reference pure aluminum sample . The
partial degradation of properties in the aluminum - CNT
composite of batch 2 may be attributed to the agglomeration of CNT ( FIG . 6 ) captured within structure of the composite object .
[ 0171 ] After exiting the bath , the filament or wire may be
dried by passing it through a convection oven heated to
about 80° C . ( i . e . , safely below the plastic ' s thermal degra
dation or softening temperatures ) . In case of metal wires
with relatively high melting or softening temperatures ( such
as above ~ 300° C . ) , the drying process may be carried out
under inert atmosphere to prevent nanocarbon combustion . After drying , the CNT particles adhere to the surface of
plastic filaments and thereby are transported to the extrusion
nozzle of the FDM or related type 3D printer . In the
extrusion nozzle , the CNT is mixed with melted polymer or
metal and extruded thereby becoming incorporated into the
structure of the 3D - printed object and producing a carbon
composite product . [ 0172 ) The bath can be envisaged as an attachment for
commercial FDM and related type 3D printers enabling
these commercial printers to produce carbon - containing products . These carbon - containing products are electrically conducting 3D - printed plastic objects which can be pro
duced from a variety of commercially available filaments
and / or wires . The incorporation of CNT into plastic imparts
increased electrical and thermal conductivity , improved
mechanical and thermal properties , as well as decreased
flammability . 0173 ] . Other type CNTs , graphenes and / or fullerenes may
also be employed in this application either alone or in
various combinations . Graphene may be present either as
graphene oxide ( which may be reduced back to graphene , e . g . , through the reaction with hydrazine ) or pure graphene . Other plastics may also be utilized in a manner described in
this example ( customized for their particular properties , e . g . , softening temperature ) . Examples of such plastics may com
prise ABS ( acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ) , polyamide , nylon , polycarbonate , polyethylene , polypropylene , polyetherimide , polyphenylsulfone , polylactic acid , a com
bination thereof , and a blend thereof . Any of those plastics
may commercially be available from many suppliers . The
resulting 3D printed product comprising nanocarbon com
posite plastic exhibit increased electrical and thermal con
ductivity , improved electrical , thermal , and mechanical
properties , as well as decreased flammability . [ 0174 ] The described process may also be used for other
metals , such as titanium , vanadium , chromium , manganese , cobalt , nickel , copper , zinc , ruthenium , rhodium , palladium , aluminum , indium , gallium , tin , silver , gold , platinum , lead , bismuth , and alloys , such as steel , bronze , brass , and a
combination thereof . Metal - plastic blends may also be used .
EXAMPLE 8
[ 0170 ] In the case of FDM technology which uses metal or
polymer wires or filaments as a feedstock , a wire or filament
may be coated with non - agglomerated and / or non - damaged CNT through the procedures illustrated in FIG . 2 and FIG . 7 . A commercial polyamide plastic filament ( typically , about
1 - 2 mm in diameter ) maybe continuously drawn through a
bath containing the aqueous suspension of non - agglomer
ated and / or non - damaged CNT of Example 1 allowing each
segment of the filament to reside in the bath for certain
amount of time , such as about 1 minute to about 15 minutes . The suspension maybe continuously agitated with a mag
netic stirrer to keep CNT distribution uniform . While being drawn through the suspension , the filament or wire will be
coated with CNT particles .

or non - damaged CNT prepared according to the process
described in Example 1 may be added to a liquid acrylic resin in a desired proportion and agitated for about 5 hours
at about 50° C . with a magnetic stirrer to ensure uniform
distribution of CNT throughout the resin ' s volume . The
liquid acrylic resin may be , in particular , MakerJuice SF
resin , and the CNT suspension may be added at about 20 wt
% . The CNT content in the resin should be high enough to
ensure desired electrical conductivity , but also low enough
to keep the viscosity below about 1 , 000 ( millipascal . second )
at about 25° C . otherwise the resin will be difficult to 3D

be used . For example , aromatic solvents with covalently
attached photocurable functional groups , such as acrylic , metacrylic , and / or epoxy and their combinations , may be
used instead of toluene to disperse and suspend CNT and
further serve as photocurable resin ingredients . Examples of
such photocurable resin ingredients are benzyl 2 - ethyl acry
late , benzyl methacrylate , pyridine acrylate , toluene acry late , xylene acrylate , and the like . The resin ingredients may comprise a single photocurable functional group ( e . g . , mono - acrylates ) , two photocurable functional groups ( e . g . , di - acrylates ) , multiple photocurable functional groups ( e . g . , tri - , tetra , and other poly - acrylates ) , and their combinations . The resulting CNT - containing resin is then loaded into an
SLA 3D printer . Under a UV or visible light irradiation , the
acrylic resin solidifies through a photopolymerization reac
tion forming the desired 3D - printed plastic object defined by
a computer system configured for this purpose . In the
photopolymerization process , the suspended non - agglomer
ated and / or non - damaged CNTs are captured within the
newly formed polymer structure imparting increased elec
trical and thermal conductivity , improved mechanical and
thermal properties , as well as decreased flammability .

color . Electrical resistivity was measured in 3D - printed objects shaped as rectangular strips ( about 10 cm in length , about 2 cm in width , about 0 . 2 cm in thickness ) using a

[ 0181 ] This example describes fabrication of reference
photopolymer resin suitable for use in SLA technology similar to Examples 10 and 11 . This resin does not contain
any carbon additives and yields electrically insulating poly

together in a glass vial and stirred with magnetic stirrer bar
at 1 , 000 rpm for 20 hours and about 50° C . Then , the mixture
was passed once through a Microfluidizer device ( Micro
fluidics , LM - 10 ) to ensure good dispersion of the ingredi
ents . The resulting carbon additive - free photocurable resin
formulation was loaded into Form labs Form1 + SLA 3D
printer to produce reference 3D - printed plastic objects of
various shapes ( FIG . 8 ( C ) ) . Both the resin and the
3D - printed objects were of weakly yellow color . Electrical
resistivity was measured in 3D - printed objects shaped as
rectangular strips ( about 10 cm in length , about 2 cm in
width , about 0 . 2 cm in thickness ) using a four - probe tech
nique . The electrical resistivity at about 25° C . was above
the measurement range of the instrument , that is , > 200
MegaOhms . cm indicating that the sample was electrically
insulating . Note that in this Example a much higher con
centration of the photoinitiator ( i . e . , 2 , 4 , 6 - trimethylbenzoyl
diphenyl phosphine oxide ) had to be used compared to the
carbon - containing resins of Examples 10 and 11 . Similar
photocurable formulations can be prepared using a variety of
other mono - and poly - functional acrlylates , methacrylates , epoxies , styrenes , urethanes , esters , silicones , acetates , gly
cols , ketones , and their combinations . For example , multi

[ 0183 ] Other type CNTs , graphenes and / or fullerenes may also be employed in this application either alone or in
various combinations . Graphene may be present either as
graphene oxide or pure graphene . The graphene oxide may be expected to be reduced to pure graphene due to the UV
radiation in the process of photopolymerization . Other pho topolymer resins , such as methacrylates , epoxies , urethanes , polyesters , silicones , and their combinations and blends may also be used in this technique . All those polymers may be
commercially available from many suppliers . Other mixing techniques such as high shear mixing , sonication , wet ball
milling , or other similar treatments and their combinations
may also be applied as needed .
[ 0184 ] Addition of nanocarbons to photopolymers may also impact the rate of photopolymerization reaction due to
strong absorption of the UV and visible range radiation by nanocarbons and very high values for free charge carrier
mobility . In nanocarbons , absorption the UV and visible
range radiation may generate photo - excited electrons that
may rapidly be re - distributed throughout the entire system . The overall impact may be beneficial resulting in notable
increase of the reaction rate due to high mobility and
eventually leading to faster production times and higher
throughput , which is essential for commercial success of 3D
printing technologies . Carbon - containing resins may also
require less photoinitiator to start the reaction leading to cost
savings since photoinitiators may be the most expensive ingredient in the photocurable resins . [ 0185 ] In that regard , of special interest may be the
fullerene photopolymer composites since fullerenes may have a rich photochemistry and , in particular , photopoly merization reactions of their own . Hence , presence of fuller
enes in nanocarbon composite materials may lead to the
highest improvement in the photopolymerization reaction
rates .
