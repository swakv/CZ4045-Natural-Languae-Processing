Not applicable.FIELD OF THE INVENTION0003. The present invention relates to 3D printers, andparticularly to 3D printers which have improved space efficiency, improved energy efficiency, improved precision,improved safety, improved motors for 3D printers, andimproved cost effectiveness.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION0004. It is a problem in the art to provide a 3D printerwhich has improved space efficiency, improved energy efficiency, improved precision, reduced noise emissions,improved safety, improved motors for 3D printers, and/orimproved cost effectiveness.0005. Further, it is also a problem in the art to provide animproved modeling filament Supply and/or novel modelingfilament materials for use in 3D printing technology.0006. It is furthermore a problem in the art to provide animproved system and method for 3D printing, which resultsin improved space efficiency, improved energy efficiency,improved precision, reduced noise emissions, improvedsafety, improved motors for 3D printers, and/or improvedcost effectiveness.0007. The present invention is directed to the form, function, and methods of use of a 3D printer and related mechanical designs, motion systems, motor technologies, backlashcompensation techniques, computer software, electronics,microcontrollers, and consumable plastic filaments. As of thetime of writing, there are several hundred models of commercially available 3D printers available or previously releasedon the market. These printers are generally categorized asbeing based on filament (extrusion) deposition, layered powder sintering, Stereo lithography, laminated model manufacturing, and similar technologies as is known in the art.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION0008. From the foregoing, it is seen that it is a problem inthe art to provide a device, system, and/or method meeting theabove requirements. According to the present invention, adevice, system, and method is provided which meets theaforementioned requirements and needs in the prior art. Specifically, the device according to the present invention provides a device for 3D printing having improved space efficiency, improved energy efficiency, improved precision,reduced noise emissions, improved safety, improved motorsfor 3D printers, and/or improved cost effectiveness.Aug. 18, 20160009. The device of the present invention provides anexemplary embodiment that is based on the reduction topractice of a filament extrusion based 3D printer.0010 Additionally, no 3D printers currently exist or haveexisted on the market which employ a positioning systembased on micro stepper motors using gear reduction technology. As will be explained further hereunder, the existing artteaches away from using Such micro reduction stepper motordue to limitations regarding speed, torque, and backlash.These motors are sometimes referred to as “uni-directionalmotors because of the great degree of backlash, and they aremost often limited to low-speed applications. By the presentinvention, a 3D printer technology is shown and describedthat employs micro reduction stepper motors in a manner thatnearly eliminates backlash in the positioning system movement, and improves the speed and torque characteristics. As aresult, the present invention shows a novel and useful 3Dprinter.0011 Furthermore, it will be appreciated by anyoneskilled in the art that many of the techniques employed Suchas new motor technologies, user Software, and backlash compensation methods can be applied to all 3D printing technologies. Therefore these inventive techniques are not limited tofilament-based 3D printers. In addition, one skilled in the artwill appreciate that the motor technologies, electronics forfaster motor driving, the use of micro motors with gearing,and backlash compensation technologies can be applied tomicro positioning systems, stages, inkjet printers, Scanner/rastering Systems, robots, IP cameras, paper feeders, air conditioner louvers, fluid dispensers, electronic pill box, andautomation technologies in general.0012. Therefore, the various aspects of the present invention as shown and described hereunder have applicability to awider field of use beyond limited 3D printers.0013. Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be more readily apparent from the following detaileddescription when read in conjunction with the accompanyingdrawings.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS0014 FIG. 1 is a front perspective view illustrating anassembled 3D printer according to the invention.0015 FIG. 2 is a back perspective view illustrating anassembled 3D printer according to the invention.0016 FIG.3 is a front view illustrating a 3D printer assembly according to the invention.0017 FIG. 4 is a side view illustrating a 3D printer assembly according to the invention.0018 FIG. 5 is a back view illustrating a 3D printer assembly according to the invention.0019 FIG. 6 is a top view illustrating a 3D printer assembly according to the invention.(0020 FIG. 7 is a bottom view illustrating a 3D printerassembly according to the invention.0021 FIG. 8 is a front perspective exploded view illustrating the parts of a 3D printer assembly according to the invention, wherein wires for the PCB, motors, and lights are notshown.0022 FIG. 9 is a rear perspective exploded view illustrating the parts of a 3D printer assembly according to the invention, wherein wires for the PCB, motors, and lights are notshown.US 2016/0236409 A10023 FIG. 10 is an exploded view illustrating the parts ofa lower gantry assembly installed on the base frame accordingto the invention, wherein wires for the PCB, motors, andlights are not shown.0024 FIG. 11 is a front perspective view illustrating a 3Dprinter with the top frame and extruder covers removed,wherein wires for the PCB, motors, and lights are not shown.0025 FIG. 12 is a rear perspective view illustrating a 3Dprinter with the top frame and extruder covers removed,wherein wires for the PCB, motors, and lights are not shown.0026 FIG. 13 is a perspective view illustrating a lowergantry assembly installed on the base frame according to theinvention, wherein wires for the PCB, motors, and lights arenot shown.0027 FIG. 14 is an upside-down rear perspective partialexploded view illustrating an extruder assembly according tothe invention, wherein wires for the PCB, motors, and fan arenot shown.0028 FIG. 15 is a front perspective partial exploded viewillustrating an extruder assembly according to the invention,wherein wires for the PCB, motors, and fan are not shown.0029 FIG. 16 is an exploded view illustrating the parts ofan extruder assembly according to the invention, whereinwires for the PCB, motors, and fan are not shown.0030 FIG. 17 is a perspective view illustrating a top gantry assembly according to the invention.0031 FIG. 18 is an exploded view illustrating the parts ofa top gantry assembly according to the invention.0032 FIG. 19 shows a front-facing section cut conceptualview of the filament material flow path within the extruder,wherein wires for the PCB, motors, and fan are not shown.0033 FIG.20 shows a perspective view of injection moldable features on the 3D printer base frame and internal bodyframe, wherein wires for the PCB, motors, and lights are notshown.0034 FIG. 21 shows a perspective view section cut ofinjection moldable features on the 3D printer top frame andbase frame.0035 FIG.22 shows a perspective view of a pulley whichhas two protrusions for connecting to bearings, and a cutthrough one side from top to bottom to provide flexibility.0036 FIG. 23 shows a top view of a pulley which has twoprotrusions for connecting to bearings, and a cut through oneside from top to bottom to provide flexibility.0037 FIG. 24 shows a perspective view of a first embodiment of a nozzle that can be used with a low-power heateraccording to the invention.0038 FIG. 25 shows a perspective view of a secondembodiment of a nozzle that can be used with a low-powerheater according to the invention.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION0039.

The overall object of the invention to provide aconstruction for a 3D printer 1 which can produce a 3Dprinted model. Referring to FIGS. 1-8, to achieve a 3D printedmodel using the 3D printer of the present invention, plasticfilament 600 provided in cord form or on filament roll 601 isunrolled by a user, from an internal or external rotationalsupport. The user pulls the filament roll 601 and subsequentlypushing it through a tube 120 inside the cable assembly 121connected to the 3Dprinting enclosure. A majorportion of thetube 120 is inside the braided cover of cable assembly 121.Cable grommet 122 protects and guides cable assembly 121at the base frame of the printer. As the filament 600 is pulledthe filament roll 601 rotates to release tension on the filament.By pushing the filament 600 through a tube 120, the filamentis guided up the tube. The filament 600 eventually passesinside the extruder body cover 871 and reaches the extrudergear 865 shown in FIG. 19. At this stage the 3D printerextruder motor takes over pulling of the filament 600 and theuser does not have to intervene except to ensure that it is beingpulled by motor through software interaction.0066 Now referring to FIG. 19, the filament 600 is compressed between the extruder gear 865 and filament bearing842 to provide friction for the pulling action. In addition, theextruder gear 865, which is driven by motorE 835, has knurling to cut and/or hobbing to guide the filament while providing grip for pulling and pushing the filament. The extrudermotors speed is metered to control the rate offilament movement as it passes through the extruder system. As the filamentis pushed by the extruder motor it moves into a nozzle 811 thathas an internal nozzle tube 815 inside to reduce friction andrelieve excessive internal pressure. A heating element 812provides heat to the nozzle 811 and subsequently, the internalnozzle tube 815, and the filament 600. The electronic controlboard 111 sets heating element 812 to predetermined temperature(s). The electronic control board 111 also providestemperature control of the heating element 812 by feedbacksensing through only two wires in total (not shown in figures).As a result, heat conducts into the filament, turning the plasticinto a molten state. The pressure from the non-molten filament above it forces the molten filament to flow through anozzle orifice. Therefore, as a result of the filament movementspeed control, molten plastic extrusion can be controlled at aproportionate rate. The filament or "plastic' may also comprise any other thermally formable material. Such as thermoplastic elastomer, metal alloys, or particle-filled plastics, andit not limited only to classic feedstocks or modeling filamentssuch as ABS plastic.0067. Now referring to FIGS. 11 and 16, A 3D printedmodel is then generated by depositing the molten extrusionacross a 2D layer in the XY plane, and then by performing amultitude of iterative layered extrusions in the Z direction.The XY motion is generated by a motorX833 which providesX-axis motion with a rack 553 and pinion gear 821 system,and a motorY 134 which provides motion through a belt andgear train, resulting in Y motion to two sides of a gantry. TheZ motion is generated by a motorZ 133 which rotates motorZrod 502 and three Z rods 501 that move the entire gantry.0068. These motors are driven by power and signals generated on the electronic control board 111 which contains amicrocontroller. The microcontroller controls the motorsaccording to a signal sent by a computer over a USB cable.The computer controls the extrusion along the XYZ pathaccording to a predetermined motion control Script.Aug. 18, 20160069. Through the use of data from sensor 859 or anothersensor (such as a capacitance displacement sensor, or anoptical linear encoder) attached to the X guide rods 552and/or Y guide rods 551, this motion control script could bemodified mid-print so the printer's movement is self-correct1ng0070 The present invention includes novel compositions,methods of manufacture, and methods of use, to improve 3Dprinters towards the major object of the invention, which is toallow for a low-cost consumer 3D printer. This can partiallybe achieved by using a combination of low-power (or nopower) and/or loose-tolerance components. When “loosetolerance' is used, it means parts or components with a largestandard deviation in batch-to-batch measurements; forexample, a shaft with 0.1 mm dimensional consistency is aloose-tolerance shaft, whereas a 0.025 mm shaft consistencyis tight-tolerance and requires a more accurate counterpartmate. Often, the loose-tolerance design is considered lessexpensive. Inclusion of design features that are novel in the artof 3D printers allow for such tolerances to be used, withoutsacrificing performance.Detailed Description of the Preferred EmbodimentsRigid Frame Design(0071 FIG. 3 illustrates a front view of an assembled 3Dprinter 1, which is a preferred embodiment according to theinvention. The 3D printer 1 comprises a base frame 101 whichis coupled to a top frame 103 and an internal body frame 102.Logo plate 104 is press-fitted into the side wall of top frame103. A logo plate insert 105 is fitted or glued into the logoplate 104.0072 Base frame 101 contains four base feet 106 whichprovides the base platform for the printer to rest on anothersurface such as a computer table. Base frame 101 providesinternal Supports for holding motors, electronics, lights,wires, cables, and a filament roll 601 as described throughoutthis specification. FIG. 20 illustrates an injection-moldedwire guide E. Top frame 103 provides a large, single, seamlessexternal product cover, and in combination with base frame101 and internal body frame 102 provides a rigid support forthe upper gantry assembly 4 seen in FIG. 17. Internal bodyframe 102 provides support for holding the removable printbed 151 as shown in FIG. 8, on which the 3D printed part isproduced. Base frame 101, internal body frame 102, and topframe 103 are preferably designed in accordance with USdesign patent application number 29/469,491 filed Oct. 10,2013 for a “Three-Dimensional Printer Frame, which isowned by the inventors and incorporated by reference herein.0073. It is an important object of the present invention toprovide a 3D printer construction which can produce a 3Dprinted model with a Smooth and consistent finish. Becausethe 3D printer of the present invention may use layering ofextrusions to produce a 3D printed model, in this context, a“high quality” or “highly smooth finish' or “consistent maybe defined as one which has less than 50 microns standarddeviation between the calculated and actually achieved layerdimensions. This definition may be applied to the surface ofthe printed model formed by multiple successive layers, andin any of the coordinate axes, X, Y, or Z, which represent aCartesian coordinate system as shown in FIG.1. It is a furtherobject of the present invention to achieve a smoothness of 20microns standard deviation or less.US 2016/0236409 A10074 As can be appreciated by one in the art, a rigid frameand printing Surface is necessary to achieve a highly smoothfinish on a 3D printed model. Therefore base frame 101,internal body frame 102, and top frame 103 are passive (nonmoving) elements and are preferably made by rigid injectionmolded plastic such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS),glass-filled ABS plastic, polycarbonate (PC), ABS/PC, polyoxymethylene (POM), plastics, composites, or thermosetting(reaction injection molded) materials with flexural modulusgreater than 250,000 PSI (at 73 degrees F.). The finishedmolded parts may be polished or painted thereafter. Thepresent invention uses PC for the base frame 101, internalbody frame 102, and top frame 103.0075 To maintain rigidity, base frame 101, internal bodyframe 102, and top frame 103 are connected by snap fits andscrews which may be redundantly connected by some or all ofthe permutations of possible part interconnections. Thesepermutations can comprise connections of base frame 101with both internal body frame 102 and top frame 103; internalbody frame 102 connections with base frame 101 and topframe 103; and top frame 103 connections with base frame101 and internal body frame 102. In addition, each part connection occurs at least two times, preferably through an identical and mirrored connections on the opposite side of theframe. The redundant connections provide additional rigidity,structural strength, and may reduce vibration and noise. Snapfits are preferred to maintain an exterior without holes forscrews, however, an alternative embodiment allows for holesand Screws to replace some or all of the Snap fit connections.In the present invention, four base screws 160 hidden underthe removable print bed 151 are used in conjunction with snapfits to hold internal body frame 102 to base frame 101. In FIG.20, Snap-fit pegs C and D can be seen, which connect baseframe 101 and internal body frame 102, in addition to the useof base screws 160. FIGS. 20 and 21 also illustrate cantileversnap-fits F on base frame 101 and their connection point Gontop frame 103. The combination of a rigid frame structure andredundant connections provide a 3D printer which canachieve the Smoothness of printed models as set forth as anobject of the invention.0076 Logo plate 104 and logo plate insert 105 are alsopassive components. Logo plate insert 105 is preferably madein the same material and finish as base frame 101, internalbody frame 102, and top frame 103. Logo plate 104 is preferably injection molded as a transparent or translucent part,such as acrylic, polycarbonate, TPU, or TPE. The front facingsurface of logo plate 104 is finished to function as a lightdiffuser when an internal logo light 112 shines onto it. This isachieved by Sandblasting the Surface, or painting with amatte-white paint. This gives a glowing long-ranging diffusion effect. In the present invention, the back of logo plate 104is painted white and the front is molded with a sandblastedtexture.General Frame Assembly Components0077 FIG.3 also illustrates an external assembled view ofan X guide rods 552, nozzle cover 813, nozzle 811, extruderfront cover 872, and cable assembly 121. The connectionbetweenthese parts and others in the assembly, as well as theirfunction, is shown in other figures.0078. Now referring to FIG. 5, which illustrates anassembled back view of the 3D printer, a computer interfaceport 111b, and power port 111a are shown. In the presentinvention, electronic control board 111 is secured to baseAug. 18, 2016frame 101 with two base screws 160. The computer interfacemay use a USB cable (not shown) connecting computer interface port 111b to a PC, tablet, or other computer device withUSB host function. The computer controls the 3D printer 1via a live "drip-feed” of positioning code. The code is sent bythe computer, through the USB cable, which connects to theelectronic control board 111 through the computer interfaceport 111b. The electronic control board 111 connects to apower Supply through power port 111a and an electricalpower cable (not shown). The electronic control board 111provides signals to control the motors, logo light 112, and aheating element 812. Signals from the sensor 859 are receivedby the electronic control board 111.General Lower Gantry Assembly Components(0079. Now referring to FIG. 13, which illustrates a perspective view showing a lower gantry assembly installed onthe base frame 101, and FIG. 10 which shows an explodedview of the same assembly. The lower gantry assembly provides Z and Y directional movement for the upper gantryassembly 4 (shown in FIG. 17).0080. In the base frame 101, the printer has a loose circularspace in the center to house a filament roll 601. There is alsoroom for the electronic control board 111 that controls the 3Dprinter. A multitude of supports in the base frame 101 and/orthe internal body frame 6 may provide pathways for anchoring electronic wires, tubes, cables, and similar parts as isknown in the art of making injection molded product encloSUCS.I0081. The base frame 101 provides support for interference fit to the outer raceway of frame bearings 141. There arefour frame bearings 141 fitted to the base frame 101, all ofwhich are preferably ball or roller bearings. These bearingssupport the bottom of the threaded Z rods 501 and square Yrod 503 by a clearance fit between a rod and the bearing innerraceway, which allows for smooth rotation of the rods.I0082. The base frame 101 also provides areas for interference fitting the motorY 134 and motorZ 133. MotorZ pulley511 connects to the threaded motorZ rod502 and the shaft ofmotorZ 133 by interference fits. Y-axis motorY pulley 512connects to the square motorY rod 504 and the shaft ofmotorY 134 by interference fits.I0083 Z belt 521 connects three Z pulleys 513 and onemotorZ pulley 511.Y belt 522 connects motorY pulley 512 toY pulley 514.I0084. Both motorZ pulley 511 and motorY pulley 512have the inner raceway of motor pulley bearings 142 press-fitonto the outside of the pulleys. The outer raceway is press fitinto internal body frame 102. Motor pulley bearings 142increases the rigidity and straightness of the Y rods 502 andmotorY rod 504 that are attached to motor shafts through apulley that is under tension from Z belt 521 and Y belt 522.The addition of motor pulley bearings 142 will prolong thelife of the motorZ 133 and motorY 134, as well as allow forhigh print qualities.I0085. The rods 501, 502, 503, 504 are preferably a rigidmaterial with high tensile modulus, preferably 30,000 PSI orgreater, such as stainless steel. Pulleys of type 511, 512, 513,514 are preferably a moldable plastic material with moderatefriction, such as glass-filled polycarbonate or glass-fillednylon or even Polyoxymethylene with a slightly rough Surface.US 2016/0236409 A1Lower Gantry Assembly Z-Movement FunctionI0086) Referring to FIG. 10, FIG. 13, and FIG. 17: Thereare three rods of type 501 which are connected to the baseframe 101 by frame bearings 141, and have a Z pulleys 513press fitted to the shaft. Pulleys 513 and 511 have groveswhich are used to transfer rotational motion, and are preferably of the MXL or GT2 type design. Three rods of type 501and one of type 502 have their rotation coupled through Zbelt521, which connect to the outside of three pulleys of type 513and pulley 511 respectively. When the motorZ 133 rotates, thethreaded Z rods 501 and motorZ rods 502 rotate in unison,causing the upper gantry 4, also known as an H-bridge, tomove up or down along the Z-axis. Using the Z rods 501 andmotorZ rod 502 to support the upper gantry 4 from all fourcorners creates redundant rigidity and Support necessary toachieve higher resolutions and print qualities.Gantry Rod End Design Allows Loose TolerancesI0087. The rotation of the top side of the rods 501,502,503,504 are supported by frame bearings 141. These frame bearings 141 are compression fit from their outer raceways to thetop frame 103. However, it is a critical feature of the inventionthat the rods 501, 502, 503, 504 have a clearance fit with theinner raceway of frame bearings 141. It is a preferred embodiment of the invention to use a clearance fit, which allowstolerances of +/-0.05 mm to +/-0.10 mm between the topframe 103, frame bearings 141, and rods 501, 502,503, 504.Using a tolerance of +/-0.10 mm is an object of the inventionbecause it allows a lower-cost design in production. Theclearance fit also allows for rapid assembly and disassembly.To assist in rapid assembly, the tops of the rods 501, 502,503,504 are dome-shaped with a fillet radius of 0.5-1.5 mm. If theinner raceway of frame bearings 141 (connected to the topframe 103) are connected to the rods 501,502,503,504 by aninterference fit, they will generate substantially limiting friction and noise to allow operation of the printer, require verysmall tolerances of +/-0.025 mm or less between the box,bearings, and rods. Tight tolerances like these are not anobject of the invention because they are very expensive inproduction and Subject to failure with defects or damage fromuSage.0088 All four Z-axis rods will not be completely constrained in the Z direction as a consequence of using clearancefits between rods 501, 502 and frame bearings 141. Thismovement would degrade the print quality and induce noisyvibrations, were it not for the use of springs washers 505. Thespring washers are Small rings with tabs protruding radiallyalong the inner diameter. The spring washers are thin, butmade of a high strength material. Such as spring steel orstainless steel. The spring washers have tabs bent into them,Some angled upwards and others angled downwards, and areinstalled between a ledge on the top of rods 501, 502 and theframe bearings 141 that are installed in top frame 103. Assembly of the printer will bend the tabs in a non-permanentmanner since the spring washer gets crushed between the rodledge and the bearing. As a result, the spring washers can beused as a gap-filler for tolerance stack-up and prevent Z. rods501 and motorZ rod 502 from shifting up and down along theZ-axis. This feature is necessary for high-quality prints, butalso accommodates the use of lower-cost loose toleranceparts. In an alternative embodiment, a rubberized coating isapplied to the areas of rods 501, 502 that come in contact withAug. 18, 2016frame bearings 141. The coating is deformed as the bearing ispressed in place, ensuring a tight fit between the two parts.Molded Bearing Interference Fit Design Allows LooseTolerances0089. A critical feature of the invention, shown in FIG.20,is a geometry as shown which can be used to provide aninterference fit between a portion of the injection moldedframes (base frame 101, internal body frame 102, and topframe 103) and the outer raceways of bearings and motors,such as motorZ 133, motorY 134, motor pulley bearing 142,and frame bearing 141. In FIG. 20, feature A is used for theinterference fit of motorY 134 and feature B is used for theinterference fit of frame bearing 141.0090 This design provides several features which allowfor a loose tolerance (0.1 mm) molded material to be able tofit a bearing. First, there is a taper which allows the press fit toprovide increasing resistance to compression as it is installed.Second, there are several asymmetrically placed protrusionswhich overlap the outer raceway position by as much as 0.1mm. This asymmetric placement helps center the bearing inposition as it is pressed in during assembly. In addition, theprotrusions provide minimal Surface area, so when a softplastic like ABS is used to mold the frame, it can be pressedout of the way to make room for a tight interference fit, despitebeing made of loose tolerance. The protrusions also provideroom for excess plastic that may be shaved off during thefitting processes to accumulate. This novel design allows aninjection mold with tolerance of 0.1 mm to fit a bearing,whereas it is taught in the standard art for a press fit to abearing to have a 0.005-0.050 mm tolerance in a part thatinterference fits a bearing.Lower Gantry Assembly Y-Movement Function(0091. The motorY 134 drives motorY pulley 512, which isconnected to square Y-axis motorY rod 504. The other squareY rod 503 has Y pulley 514 compression fitted to it. Y belt 522connects to the outsides of the pulleys connected to Y rods503 and motorY rod 504, coupling their rotation. Thiscoupled motion of square Y rods 503 and motorY rod 504 istransferred to the upper gantry assembly 4.Upper Gantry (H-Bridge) Assembly General Function0092. Now referring to FIG. 17 and FIG. 18, which illustrate an assembled and an exploded perspective view of theupper gantry assembly 4. Two front gantry Supports 531 andtwo rear gantry Supports 532 each are respectively connectedto a threaded Z rod 501 or motorZ rod 502 through threadsVertically tapped inside each gantry Support at the positionwhere the threaded rods meet these supports. An alternativeembodiment includes an internally molded or inserted metalnut to provide threads. The rotation of the threaded Z rod 501or motorZ rod 502 results in vertical motion of the gantryassembly 4.0093. The front and rear gantry supports should be constructed of a durable, low-friction material such as Polyoxymethylene, Polyamide, or Ultra High Molecular WeightPolyethylene, so that the force required to move the Z axis iskept to a minimum and so that the internal threads are easy tomachine and withstand wear from repeated usage. In an alternate embodiment, the front and rear gantry Support are madeof nylon 66, for even greater wear resistance of the internalthreading.US 2016/0236409 A1Z Movement Rod Threads and Diameter Design0094. In one embodiment the threading in front gantrysupports 531 and rear gantry supports 532 are of type 8-32,and in another embodiment it is of type 8-24 or M5, and thethreading of the rods 501 and 502 match. Although it mayseem obvious at first that any threading could work, it is acritical embodiment of the invention to allow the use of lowcost components that allow for a high quality 3D prints. Whenan acme “leadscrew rod is used, the most accurate type ofrod, the costs are unacceptably high for the present invention,and the diameters are also too large. When a large diameterthreaded rod is used, such as 3/8", it is severely limiting to thepresent invention. The high rigidity of these rods due to theirmass requires that they are perfectly straight—any imperfection in the geometric straightness tolerance (or “wobble')would result in an unwanted shift in the upper gantry assembly position, which in turn would lead to very poor printaccuracy or Smoothness, and increased resistance to rotationof the rods, which could lead to a stalled motor condition. Inaddition, large diameter rods reduce the space efficiency ofthe printer, and demand exponentially more motor drivingtorque. Where more motor torque is required to turn theserods, the cost of the motors increases, and so does their powerconsumption, which increases the cost of electronics andpower components, and becomes prohibitively expensive.For example, the torque increases proportional to radius ofthe rod. However, as the radius increases, the circumferenceof the rod increases as well, proportionate to two times radius(2*radius). Therefore the net friction on the rods increases bythe friction times the lever action distance, orradius;2*radius=2*radius. Therefore it is critical to theinvention that smaller diameter rods are used. Smaller diameter rods also flex more before they result in permanent deformation, allowing a 3D printer to be designed with loosertolerances and friction. Small diameter rods also cost less andweigh less, which is desirable as an object of the invention.However, if the threaded rod diameter is too small, the rigidityof the gantry would become weak, and the number of rotations required to achieve Z translational motion wouldincrease significantly. For these reasons, we claim a 3Dprinter with the design of threaded rods where the threadedrod is preferably between 2 mm diameter and 6.35 mm, ormore preferably between 3.0 and 5.0 mm, where the threadsper inch are preferably between 12 and 60, and most preferably between 20 and 32. As it will be appreciated by one in theart, when a gantry is Suspended by threaded rods, there mustbeat least 3 threaded rods to define the plane of the top gantryassembly. Therefore we claim these designs when there are atleast 3 threaded rods, even though the picture shows 4threaded rods, any number above 3 could be used.Upper Gantry Assembly YMovement Function0095 Front gantry supports 531 and rear gantry supports532 are connected to two identical Y guide rods 551 via pegsas part of said gantry supports as illustrated in FIG. 18. In thisembodiment, it is critical that the pegs have a very lightinterference or are clearance fitted with glue on the pegs to theY guide rods 551 to prevent expansion of the rods that wouldincrease friction on the moving elements or result in thesplitting of Y guide rods 551. An alternative embodiment alight interference fit for quick assembly using holes in thegantry Supports.0096 Square Y rods 503 and motorY rod 504 have uppergantry drive pulleys 515 clearance fit to them. Pulleys of typeAug. 18, 2016515 are preferably a moldable plastic material with low tomoderate friction and good wear resistance. Such as glassfilled polycarbonate or glass-filled nylon. Another possiblematerial choice would be polyoxymethylene, which is thematerial used in the present invention. In this embodiment thetolerance of the fit between the upper gantry drive pulleys 515and the square Y rod 503 and motorY rod 504 must be lessthan 0.05 mm, and more ideally less than 0.025 mm to minimize backlash while limiting friction; even so this designwould wear over time, increasing backlash. Backlash occurswhen the direction of rotation changes.0097. To provide linear motion, two identical upper gantrybelts 523 are attached to upper gantry drive pulleys 515.When the motorY 134 rotates, the square Y rods 503 andmotorY rod 504 rotate, and in turn the upper gantry drivepulleys 515 rotate. Upper gantry drive pulleys 515 have asquare hole which allows the square Y rod 503 and motorYrod 504 to slide through said pulleys as the upper gantry 4 ismoved up and down the Z axis. The purpose of this sliding isto allow the motorY 134 in the base of the printer to controlthe upper gantry belts 523, regardless of the position the Zaxis of the upper gantry 4. This allows much more efficientuse of the printer's volume for printing than if the motorY 134was directly attached to the upper gantry.0098. One end of each upper gantry belt 523 is tensionedby wrapping them around upper gantry idler pulley 516 whichare concentric with Z. rods 501 and motorZ rod 502. Uppergantry idler pulley 516 has two flanges two retain the belt andan upper gantry bearing 517 press fit on either end. Uppergantry idler pulley 516 and the two upper gantry bearings 517slide into the rear gantry Support 532 and are kept in placefrom the tension of upper gantry belts 523. The Zrods 501 andmotorZ rod 502 thread into rear gantry supports 532 and gothrough the upper gantry idlerpulley 516 and the upper gantrybearing 517, but do not actually come in contact with the innerdiameter of the upper gantry idler pulley 516 or the uppergantry bearing 517. The upper gantry idler pulley 516 and theupper gantry bearings 517 are constrained to stay with theupper gantry 4 as it moves up and down the Z axis via thegantry Supports 532. In an alternate embodiment the uppergantry idler pulley 516 and the upper gantry bearings 517replaced with a double flanged, grooved, or V-cut bearing. Inorder to retain the double flanged, grooved, or V-cut bearinginto rear gantry support 532, the bearing would have a thinwalled tube press-fit into the inner diameter of the bearing, orthe inner raceway of the bearing would be extended both waysin the axial direction.(0099 Left slider 533 and right slider 534 are attached toupper gantry belts 523 securely using teeth built into thesliders which interlock with the teeth of said belts. In thedesign shown, the upper gantry belts 523 are an open loop toallow the assembly worker to thread the belt through a hole infront gantry support 531. The ends of upper gantry belts 523are pressed into the interlocking teeth of left slider 533 andright slider 534 and secured with glue or small set screws. Inan alternative embodiment, upper gantry belts 523 are aclosed, continuous loop that is secured into left slider 533 andright slider 534 with glue or small set screws. In this embodiment, the front gantry supports 531 must have slot in them inorder for the closed upper gantry belts 523 to be installed.0100 Left slider 533 and right slider 534 are preferablymade of low friction materials such as polyoxymethylene(POM) or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) such that they create little frictional resistance to motion of the Y axis. TheUS 2016/0236409 A1current design uses POM as the material for left slider 533 andright slider 534. Left slider 533 and right slider 534 are alsodesigned to snap onto Yguide rods 551 quickly and easily forassembly.0101 The design of said connection to Yguide rods 551 issuch that it allows for poor tolerances in Y guide rods 551 byflexing to allow a loose interference fit. Even as material lossoccurs on left slider 533 and right slider 534 due to frictionwith Y guide rods 551, the curved shape of the connections onleft slider 533 and right slider 534 will continue to flexinwards and maintain contact with Y guide rods 551. Thesame concept is applied to the connection between motorXhousing 801 and X guide rods 552. This allows an acceptablelow-cost, tight-tolerance fit with respect to the imperfectionsof manufacturing and wear during usage, providing precisionand low friction regardless, yielding a novel type of bushingor bearing geometry.—0102 X guide rods 552 are for support and sliding of theextruder 5 in the X axis. Said rods are attached to left slider533 and right slider 534 using holes or pegs in the same wayas described earlier thatY guide rods 551 are attached to frontgantry supports 531 and rear gantry supports 532. Whenupper gantry belts 523 rotate, they rotate at the same rate sincethey are coupled through Y belt 522, located beneath theinternal body frame 102. Said rotation causes left slider 533and right slider 534 to move forward and backward along theY axis. Said movement causes the entire gantry portionattached to left slider 533 and right slider 534, including Xguide rods 552 and Y guide rods 551, to move along the YaX1S.(0103 Y guide rods 551 and X guide rods 552 are constructed of a rigid material which also has a low coefficient offriction with respect to the material used to make left slider533 and right slider 534, as well as the portion of extruder 5which slides on rods Y guide rods 551 and X guide rods 552.There are many acceptable materials such as stainless steel,carbon fiber, fiberglass, carbon fiber, glass reinforced polymer composites, brass, or aluminum. The preferred embodiment uses carbon fiber, which provides high rigidity, gooddampening characteristics, low weight, and is very resistantto permanent deformation due to bending. Because carbonfiber is rigid, it also allows less material to be used, allowingus to maximize print area VS printer Volume. Furthermore,carbon fiber rods have a low coefficient of friction whencombined with sliders/bushings of Polyoxymethylene, PTFEor other plastic materials. The carbon fiber's rigidity contributes significantly to the print quality, portability of the printer,and the ability of the printer to maximize space, and is a noveldesign component. The carbon fiber rods may be constructedby weaving or pultrusion, where pultrusion provides a preferable design because the carbon fibers are oriented in thedirection of motion, reducing friction.Gantry Space Efficiency Optimizations Achieve a LowerCost Printer Design0104. It is an object of the invention to provide a low-cost3D printer, and one way to achieve lower-cost is reducing thetotal Volume and weight of the product. The gantry designpresented in the invention is therefore critical to enabling alow-cost printer because it is much more space efficient thanthe prior art, and provides a large gantry movement rangewithin a tight space. Specifically, the present inventionachieves an X print range of 113 mm, a Y print range of 114mm, and a Z print range of 113 mm, while the box frame isAug. 18, 2016186 mm per side in a cube shape. These component make useof over 50-60% of the available linear space. They take advantage of the fact that the distance from each edge of the box tothe beginning of the linear motion range only require 36.5mm for the X, 36 mm for the Y, and about 43 mm from thebottom and 30 mm from the top for the Z.Upper Gantry X Movement Function0105 Rack 553 is used by extruder 5 to move along the Xaxis as defined in FIG. 1 using MotorX833 which has a shaftattached to pinion gear 821. When said motor rotates, piniongear 821 rotates and causes the extruder assembly 5 to moveleft or right along the X axis. X guide rods 552 force extruder5 to move straight and precisely along the X axis when piniongear 821 moves said extruder assembly. In the same way, Yguide rods 551 force left slider 533 and right slider 534 tomove straight and precisely along the Y axis when uppergantry belts 523 rotate together.Upper Gantry Y. Movement Alternative Embodiment UsingHigh Tolerance Split Pulleys0106. In this embodiment, the front gantry supports 531uses the same style of split pulley as illustrated in FIGS. 22and 23. The object of the upper gantry split drive pulley 518is to account for loose tolerances of the square Y rods 503 andmotorY rod 504, and the tolerance of the upper gantry splitdrive pulley 518, which can be made by injection molding,through the use of a design that incorporates split section H,as shown in FIGS. 22 and 23. The split section His enlargedin FIGS. 22 and 23 for clarity purposes and preferably meaSures less than 1 mm in thickness. Upper gantry split drivepulley 518 is loosely fit within upper gantry bearing 517 suchthat if the split pulley expands or contracts due to inconsistencies in the thickness of square Y rods 503 and motorY rod504, it has room to expand. Despite the loose fit, the belttension of upper gantry belts 523 keep said split pulley'scenter location from changing significantly as the split pulleyexpands and contracts with changing thickness of the squareY rods 503 and motorY rod 504. The two flanges on the uppergantry split drive pulley 518 can be molded as part of thepulley design (as shown), or as a separate piece (not shown)for low cost manufacturing. The separate flange is held inplace loosely between the upper gantry split drive pulley 518and the upper gantry bearings 517. In addition, the split pulleydesign allows for the upper gantry belts 523 to be placedcentered on the Y guide rods 551. This is visually appealingand also provided more balanced forces which increase thelife of all gantry Supports and sliders.0107 To prevent high friction on said square rods, uppergantry bearing 517 are used on either side of upper gantrysplit drive pulley 518 to balance the forces on either side ofsaid pulley and transfer the forces from the pulley to thebearings and through the front gantry Support 531 and Y guiderods 551. As a result, the forces on the square Y rods 503 andmotorY rod 504 resulting from the tension of upper gantrybelts 523 are greatly reduced. This minimizes the bending ofthe square rod due to tension of upper gantry belts 523, whichwould have resulted in inaccurate print dimensions.0108. In another embodiment for the upper gantry idlerpulleys 516, only one upper gantry bearing 517 is used pereach side of the gantry and said bearings are Supported with ascrew through the middle. Double-flanged pulleys areUS 2016/0236409 A1attached to the bearings using a compression fit and uppergantry belts 523 are wrapped around said pulleys.General Extruder Assembly Design0109) Now referring to FIG. 1, which illustrates anassembled perspective view of the 3D printer 1, including theextruder 5. The only extruder parts that can be seen externallyfrom this view comprise the extruder body cover 871,extruder front cover 872, and braided cable cover on cableassembly 121. The extruder 5 moves in the X linear directionthrough internally supplied motion. The movement ofextruder 5 is also controlled by the gantry assembly, whichprovides motion in the Yand Zlinear directions. The extruderassembly also provides heat for the filament extrusion process, extrusion of filaments through internally Suppliedmotion, position feedback measurement through sensor 859,and a heat generating conductive material with a linear temperature coefficient (heating element 812) to allow for indirect measurement of temperature from the electronic controlboard 111. The extruder 5 comprises the cable assembly 121,which has a mesh sleeve that protects and guides electronicwires (not shown) and a filament tube 120 inside it, whileproviding a single external material for aesthetics. Cableassembly 121 contains within it wires to power the heatingelement, motors, and may also include wires for positionfeedback sensing.0110. Inside of extruder 5 (FIG. 15), the electronic wires(not shown) and filament tube 120 of cable assembly 121 areretained in cable strain relief 123, which is PVC overmoldedaround the wires and filament tube 120. Extruder body cover871 has a slot on the bottom in which fan 829 is glued orpress-fit into place. Upper vents on extruder body cover 871are used for both exhaust of heat and/or intake of cool air. Asmall gap between extruder body cover 871 and extruder frontcover 872 allows for additional ventilation of extruder 5. Fan829 is responsible for both removing excess heat from insideextruder 5, as well as quickly cooling the extruded filament asit is laid out layer-by layer to form a 3D-printed object.0111. The extruder body cover 871 holds the cable assembly 121 using a compression fit or glue on the cable strainrelief 123. In an alternative embodiment, a grooved grommetor crimped metal band may be used to connect the cableassembly 121 to the extruder body cover 871.0112 The extruder assembly 5 is covered by an extruderbody cover 871 and extruder front cover 872. The extruderfront cover 872 has snap-fit hooks that latch onto extruderbody cover 871 allowing for quick assembly and easy, toolless access to the internals of the extruder. In an alternativeembodiment, extruder 5 is covered with a single pieceextruder body cover that snaps on from above onto motorEhousing 851 and motorX housing 801. Extruder body cover871 and extruder front cover 872 are injection molded partswhich could be made of polypropylene (PP), high-densitypolyethylene (HDPE), polyamide 6 (PA6), or polyamide 66(PA66). In this instance, the extruder body cover 871 andextruder front cover 872 are both made of PA6 blended withreinforcing glass fibers.Extruder Assembly X Movement Design0113 Now referring to FIG. 15, which illustrates the internal components of the extruder assembly 5, and FIG. 16,which illustrates an exploded view of the extruder assemblyinternal components. MotorX 833 provides linear motionAug. 18, 2016along the X-axis for the extruder assembly as detailed in theearlier section titled “Upper Gantry X Movement Function'.MotorX 833 is preferably constructed of a 4-wire, bipolar,2-phase, micro stepper motor with a gear reduction between1:4 to 1:64, and more preferably 1:16. Preferably, the size ofthis motor is between 15 and 35 mm, and more preferably it isabout 24 mm. MotorX 833 connects to the motorX housing801 by an interference fit. MotorX housing 801 connects tothe X guide rods 552 by two C-shaped guides that snapsaround the X guide rods 552. In an alternative embodiment, Xguide rods 552 are clasped between motorXhousing 801 andanbottom cover plate (not shown) that are fitted together withscrews or a Snap fit. The C-shaped guides of motorXhousing801 serves as a linear bearing in the X-axis direction, and aretherefore preferably constructed of a low friction injectionmolded material such as polyoxymethylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, or polyamide. Additionally, the geometry ofmotorX housing 801 may be designed to provide flexibilityagainst an excessively tight linear bearing fit, such as byincluding slits or thin wall sections, allowing the extruderassembly to serve as a tight tolerance linear bearing. Theflexibility of motorX housing 801 may lower the sliding friction between motorX housing 801 and X guide rods 552, aswell as compensate for material loss from the wear of theplastic throughout the lifetime of the 3D printer 1, or poortolerances in manufacturing.Extrusion System Design0114. After motorX833 is installed into the motorXhousing 801, the motorX housing is connected to the motorEhousing 851 through an interference fit. Alternatively theparts may be designed to be connected with screws or Snapfits. The motorE housing 851 may be diecast or CNCed out ofa lightweight metal such as aluminum or Zinc to provide heatdistribution throughout the extruder assembly. It is also possible to construct motorE housing 851 by injection molding itout of a plastic, such as ABS. To provide extrusion offilamentduring 3D printing, motorE 835 is connected to the inside ofthe motorE housing 851 by a compression fit. The motorE835 is preferably constructed of a 4-wire, bipolar, 2-phase,micro stepper motor with a gear reduction of about 1:16 to1:64, and more preferably 1:64. Preferably, the size of thismotor is between 15 and 35 mm, and more preferably it isabout 24 mm.0115 Extruder gear bearing 846 is pressed onto extrudergear 865 and held in place by a compression fit into themotorE housing 851. Extruder gear bearing 846 is preferablya radial ball bearing with an inner diameter between 4 and 7mm, and more preferably has an inner diameter of 7 mm.Extruder gear bearing 846 may have a thickness between 2-5mm and an outer diameter between 7-12 mm. Extruder gearbearing 846 supports axial loads on the extruder gear 865during filament extrusion, preventing flexing of the motorshaft, which ensures positioning accuracy of the motor shaft,which ensures a properamount of force on the filament beingextruded, and also extends motor life.0116 Filament bearing 842 is held into motorE housing851 with an interference fit between the inner raceway offilament bearing 842 and a peg that is part of motorE housing851. The bearing is preferably a radial ball bearing withapproximately a 6 mm inner diameter, 3 mm thickness, and10 mm outer diameter, though other sizes bearings may beused. As an alternative, the bearing may be held onto motorEhousing 851 with the use of screw. The filament bearing 842US 2016/0236409 A1reduces friction during filament extrusion while also guidingthe filament and keeping pressure against the motor shaft.Gear cover 861, which is made of a plastic with low frictionand good wear resistance such as nylon or POM, covers theextruder gear 865 and filament bearing 842 and guides thefilament 600 so it travels into internal nozzle tube 815. Gearcover 861 is secured with gear cover screw 862, which allowseasy access for the user in the event of a clog or filament jamnear the extruder gear 865.0117. In alternative embodiments, motorE835 may have acustom knurled or hobbed shaft or may include an additionaladapter containing knurling or hobbing to improve contactwith filaments. This custom motor shaft that is capable ofgripping filament would eliminate the need for using extrudergear 865 as a separate part from the motor. In this embodiment, extruder gear bearing 846 is pressed onto the shaft ofmotorE 835 and is preferably a radial ball bearing with aninner diameter between 3 and 7 mm, and more preferably hasan inner diameter of 4-5 mm.0118. To provide heating for plastic extrusion during 3Dprinting, a nozzle 811 is installed by press fitting or screwinginto motorE housing 851 (or, alternatively, into motorXhousing 801). The extruder nozzle is a novel unitary design whichprovides four functions: It transfers and buffers heat from alow-power heating element 812 to the filament 600; it provides a nozzle hole at the bottom exit for filament 600 extrusion; it holds an internal nozzle tube 815; and it providesthermal isolation from the motorE housing 851. As will beappreciated by one in the art, the combined function of theextruder nozzle in a unitary nozzle is novel, unobvious, and isuseful, and cannot be achieved by any combination of theprior art.Extruder Assembly Filament Guide Design0119) The internal nozzle tube 815 provides a surface forcontact with plastic feedstock in the form offilaments or rodsbetween 1 and 3 mm diameter, in which the plastic can beheated without sticking to the inside walls of the nozzle 811.It is connected to nozzle 811 as a compression fit and may alsobe physically constrained by motorX housing 801 and/ormotorE housing 851 after installation.0120 In this embodiment, the internal nozzle tube 815may only be constructed of a material with long-term resistance to creep under thermal loads of 230 degrees C., whilealso providing a slippery Surface defined as having a coefficient of thermal expansion less than 0.2. If the friction coefficient is higher than this number, the filament will jamagainst the walls under its own pressure. While materials likegraphite and wood may meet this requirement, they would besubject to brittle failure over time. Materials that meet thisrequirement therefore may comprise Perfluoroalkoxy (PFA),Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and Fluorinated ethylenepropylene (FEP), and similar materials. The most preferablematerial is PTFE with an inner diameter between 2.0-3.0 mm,and an external diameter between 3.0-6.0 mm. The presentinvention uses an internal nozzle tube 815 with an innerdiameter of 2.0 mm and a wall thickness of 0.75 mm.Extruder Assembly Low-Power Heating Element Design0121. A low-power heating element 812 is used to provideheat evenly around the nozzle 811. Heating element 812 is inthe shape of a tube that is designed to fit around the cylindricalnozzle 811, contacting each other around all 360 degrees. It isAug. 18, 2016an object of the present invention to provide a compact 3Dprinter, thus a low power heating element is needed, one thatuses up to 12 volts and uses 5-15 watts of power, and mostpreferably only uses 5V or less and uses less than 10 watts ofpower, due to the compatibility of this power profile withsupplies on the market. The heating element 812 may beproduced by wrapping conducting wire around a core andcoating it with ceramic pastes, such as alumina or Zirconia,and firing gradually up to at least 225 degrees C. to preventcrack formation. It is preferably a tough material made fromalumina or Zirconia. Because the heat is provided evenlyaround the nozzle 811, which then conducts the heat evenly tothe internal nozzle tube 815, the filament 600 will be heatedmore evenly during extrusion. This allows for more accurateprints with fewer jams, without the use of a high-power heating element. In the prior art, all nozzles are heated asymmetrically and not radially, which requires higher power heatingelements in order to prevent jamming due to under-heatedfilament failing to extrude. It is preferable that the heatingelement wires are made of a material with predictable andlinear temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) within therange of 0.10*(10/ C.) to 10*(10/ C.), such that thetemperature of the extrusion process can be measured in theheating element 812 indirectly by monitoring electrical current used by heating element 812 with the electronic controlboard 111 in the 3D printer 1. However, since it is an object ofthe present invention to use less than 15W of power, and theheating element 812 uses preferably around 7 W at 230degrees C., it would use too much power at room temperatureto have a TCR greater than 5*(107°C.) while meeting this230 degrees C. constraint. However, if the TCR was less than1*(10/C.) it would require more sensitive (and expensive)Voltage dividers and amplifiers to detect a change measurableby an analog-to-digital converter. Therefore, an ideal TCRmaterial may include nickel, tungsten, copper, tin, Zinc, silver, or aluminum, and most ideally uses either tungsten ornickel due to their ability to ensure oxidation at high temperatures for long periods of time. Heating elements of this typecan be produced as is known in the art, such as shown in U.S.Pat. No. 6,169,275 B1, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,753,893 A. However, heating elements of this type are primarily optimized asoxygen sensors and not as tubular (radial) heating elementsfor filament extrusion. Since it is an object of the describedinvention to use tubular ceramic heating elements to meltfilament within a 5-7 mm heated Zone, while maintaining ashort length of 9-12 mm, and providing a specific range ofTCR element, and tubular structure with wall thickness of1-1.5 mm, we have created a novel low-voltage heating element suitable only for use in the 3D printer of the presentinvention.Safe Printer Heating Element DesignI0122. It is an object of the invention to provide a “safe'3Dprinter that cannot harm the user or endanger them throughthermal runaway, which could lead to fire or off gassing ofdangerous fumes. Therefore it is critical to the invention thatthermistors are not used, and this is a novel design. Thermistors are traditionally used because they can provide accurate temperature readings without signal amplification, butonly once they reach a high temperature. Thermistors addcosts to a 3D printer, as well as a significant risk. The risksinclude breakage of the thermistor, which would void function, and could lead to a runaway thermal overload situation,which could be a fire hazard. In addition, a thermistor isUS 2016/0236409 A1typically mounted outside of the where the filament is actually heated. This distance of the thermistor from the actualfilament melt Zone results in inaccurate temperature measurements, which could lead to overheating of the filaments, pooror excessive printing layer adhesion, nozzle ooze, inconsistent printing temperatures, and poor responsive times to outside cooling or heating forces. By contrast, the indirect temperature reading of the heating element coils itself is a farmore reliable, consistent, and direct measurement which dramatically increases reliability, consistency, and reduces theoverall cost of the components needed to make 3D printer. Inaddition, it is a safety features that the heating element 812 isalso the temperature sensing element, so it is impossible tooverheat or cause a thermal runaway scenario.Heating Element Insulator Design Option0123. An alternative embodiment of the present inventionmay include a nozzle cover 813, which may: further reducethe power requirements of the low power heating element812; may prevent the nozzle 811 from moving or vibrating outof position, thereby improving print Smoothness; may reducethe risk of users getting burns from coming in contact with thehot nozzle 811; and may prevent extruded molten plastic frombuilding up on the end of the nozzle over extended usage. Theheat insulator needs to be able to handle 230 degrees C. overlong periods of time while limiting heat conduction. It maytherefore be made out of fiberglass laminates, silicone, mica,kapton, cellulose, and other insulating material. It may bebound in place by compression fitting or by glue, either to theheating element 812, nozzle 811, motorX housing 801, ormotorE housing 851.Low-Power Unitary Extruder Nozzle Design0.124 Referring now to FIG. 12, the nozzle 811 may beproduced by a material with thermal conductivity between 1and 100 W/mK. If the thermal conductivity is too low, it maynot be able to transfer heat evenly or quickly, but if it is toohigh it will dissipate heat too rapidly, thus it is more preferableto have the nozzle a thermal conductivity between 5 and 30W/mK. The nozzle material must be rigid enough to preventflexing during printing, which would result in inaccurateprints. The material needs to be durable enough to preventbrittle fracture due to shock or pressure. Example materialsthat the nozzle may be constructed of that meet these constraints may include alumina, Zirconia, stainless steel, carbonsteel, and titanium, with the most preferable material beingstainless steel 303 or 304. The nozzle exterior may be produced by turning processes, while the nozzle holes may beproduced by drilling, wire cutting, or laser. Alternatively, thenoZZle body may be produced by casting, sintering, or 3Dprinting processes with some post processing.0.125. The nozzle exit hole may have a diameter between0.25 and 1.0 mm. However, as the nozzle diameter isdecreased, the number of manufacturing and 3D printeroperational difficulties increase. For instance, the amount ofundesired filament extrusion due to internal filament thermalexpansion and gas generation which may reduce print quality,also known as 'ooze', increases exponentially with decreasing nozzle size. For example, a 0.25 mm nozzle would ooze atapproximately four times the rate of a 0.5mm nozzle based onVolumetric expansion of plastic filaments, resulting in unintended extrusion on a 3D printed model edges. In addition,smaller diameter nozzles are extremely difficult to machine orAug. 18, 2016machine accurately with reasonable concentricity and tolerances by traditional processes such as drilling. Specifically, itis challenging to drill holes in stainless steel or titanium below0.35 mm due to the hardness of the material and the brittlenature of small drill bits. As a result, the only way to achievesmaller diameters would include drilling, which would havelarge failure rates; wire electrode discharge machining, whichis expensive; and laserablation, which is time consuming andexpensive. Furthermore, during the 3D printing extrusionprocess, it is possible that latent dust, contaminant particles inthe plastic filament feed, and even decomposed residual plastic may clog a nozzle, the chances of which increase exponentially with smaller nozzle orifice size. Finally, smallerextrusion diameters increase the pressure on the extrudermotor, requiring more motor energy or higher gearing. However, larger sized noZZles above 0.5 mm may produce lessdesirable feature resolution. It is therefore most preferablewhen making the nozzle 811 to have a size range to at 0.35-0.5mm. For similar reasons, it is preferable to have a minimumnozzle hole length of about 0.5 mm-1.0 mm.I0126. It is important as set forthin this specification for thenozzle 811 to provide thermal conductivity and thermal buffering in combination with heating element 812 and internalnozzle tube 815 to the plastic extrusion. This is preferablyachieved by a bottom portion of the nozzle having between5.0 to 12.0 mm of length containing stainless steel with a wallthickness of about 0.25 to 0.75 mm. Due to the minimumouter diameter of internal nozzle tube 815, which is about2.5-3.5 mm, the nozzle 811 inner diameter is limited to about2.5-3.5 mm.0127. The outer diameter of the nozzle 811 is also limitedbecause a larger diameter nozzle increases the thermal massof the system and increases the heat lost due to convectiveSurface effects, increasing the power requirements of theheating system, and decreasing responsiveness. However, asset forth in the ideal embodiment, a low power heating element is desired. Because of the minimum strength requirements of the heating element 812, the wall thickness of theheating element would be 1-2 mm. Through careful experimentation, it was discovered that heat dissipation becamerapid above an external heating element diameter of 8.0 mm,necessitating a combination of a thermal break, a more powerful heating element, and also thermal insulation with nozzlecover 813 around the heating element 812 to allow temperature to reach at least 230 C (a temperature needed for theextrusion of ABS and other common plastic filaments). It istherefore desirable to keep the heating element 812 outerdiameter below 8.0 mm, and this results in a preferred heatingelement 812 inner diameter of 4.0 to 6.0 mm. As a result, themaximum outer diameter of the stainless steel nozzle 811must also be between 4.0 to 6.0 mm, and is most preferablybetween 4.5 and 5.5 mm. When taking into account the preferred wall thickness of nozzle 811, which is 0.25 to 0.75 mm,the inner diameter of the heat transfer region of nozzle 811can only be between 2.5 and 5.5 mm, and it most preferably3.5 mm.I0128 Finally, it is critical as set forth in this specificationthat the nozzle 811 limits heat transfer towards the extrudergear along the path the filament 600 travels before beingextruded. Excess heat will cause the filament to soften outsideof the heat transfer region of the nozzle 811 which will causefilament jams. Thus, there must be a thermal break in thenozzle 811. The thermal break prevents heat transfer throughthe heating element nozzle by three means: it provides anUS 2016/0236409 A1elongated heat conduction path; it provides additional Surfacearea for convective cooling; and it provides reduced thermalmass by reducing the amount of material heat can conductthrough, which is achieved by having a thin walls. The wallthickness of the nozzle 811 above the heat transfer Zone isbetween 0.15 and 0.30 mm, and in this embodiment they are0.20 mm. It is preferable in this design that a combination ofreduced heat flow area and elongated conductive path lengthare achieved.0129. In an alternative embodiment seen in FIGS. 24 and25, holes J. Staggered slots (not shown), or spiral cuts 24 areadded in the thermal buffer Zone of the nozzle. Further reducing the amount of mass and increasing the heat transfer pathlength should decrease the rate of heat transferred away fromthe heat transfer Zone. For example, in spiral cut nozzle 809 aspiral section of 12.5 min length is provided. This sectionreduces the amount of surface area by about 40% to 60%,while increasing the conductive path travellength from about12.5 to about 30.0 mm or 240%. Therefore the net impact ofthis geometry is calculated by average new path travellength/average surface area reduction, or 240%/I60%=400%. This design therefore provides a 4-fold increase inthe amount resistance to heat conduction, not accounting forconvective effects or conduction through the internal nozzletube 815. A similar example using perforated nozzle 810shows a reduction in Surface area and mass due to a pluralityof holes, each with a diameter of 0.25 to 2.5 mm (2.0 mm, asshown). These designs were not chosen for use due to thecomplexities they add to manufacturing, as well as thedecreased strength of the nozzle. The present invention usesnozzle 811, which has with 0.20 mm thick walls made ofstainless steel and an internal nozzle tube 815 made of PTFEwith 0.75 mm thick walls.0130. The observed effect of the thermal break is to reducetemperatures from about 230 degrees C. to less than 100degrees C. (steady state) at the anchoring point in motorEhousing 851, and more ideally to less than 60 degrees C. Anyincrease in the diameter or thickness of the nozzle 811 wouldboth increase the amount of heat conducted to the anchoringpoint and increase the amount of heat dissipated by the heating element, violating the low power objective of the presentinvention. In addition it is desirable for 3D printer extrudernoZZles to have a rapid thermal transition, reducing jammingof plastic in the nozzle due to the Stickiness of plastic in asemi-molten state. While a larger diameter and larger powered heating element nozzle could be used, it would require alonger thermal break, which would be difficult to fit in acompact design and could require a more powerful motor topush the filament. It is therefore an object of the invention toprovide a nozzle 811 with a length of 15 to 40 mm, and morepreferably between 25 to 35 mm, which has a thermal breakregion of at least 5-10 mm.0131 By way of illustration of the advantages of thepresent invention as compared with the prior art, it can be seenthat the present invention differs substantially from U.S. Pat.No. 6,004,124 by Swanson and Hopkins which describes astainless steel extrusion nozzle, and there are at least fourmajor differences, as follows:(0132. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,004,124, a thin-walled stainlesssteel nozzle is used as both the heat isolation and heat conduction sections; by contrast in the present invention theaddition of spiral cuts or holes to the nozzle, such as withspiral cut nozzle 809 or perforated nozzle 810, provide heatisolation and can easily accommodate thicker walled sectionsAug. 18, 2016Such as 0.5 mm, whereas the prior art example describes amaximum wall thickness of 0.381 mm.0.133 Also, U.S. Pat. No. 6,004,124 teaches the use of thestainless steel as the Surface in direct contact with moltenmodeling filament, whereas in the present invention a sleeveof PTFE (internal nozzle tube 815) provides direct contactwith molten filament, reducing friction.0134) Furthermore, U.S. Pat. No. 6,004,124 describes theuse of a heating element block with an independent heatingelement, whereas the present invention provides for a nozzlethat is radially heated (that is, evenly heated from all sides)with an integral and evenly dispersed heating element.0.135 Also, above-noted prior art example describes thetransition of filament from a solid to a molten state whiletraveling through a thin-wall nozzle, whereas the presentinvention exclusively provides for the possible inclusion ofthin-walled stainless steel sections only where the filament issolid and within the thermal break region.(0.136 Finally, the inclusion of PTFE internal nozzle tube815 inside of nozzle 811 creates a double-wall design, wherethere is an inner wall made of PTFE and an outer wall madeof stainless steel. In this design, there are no regions with awall thickness that could fall in the thin-wall tube thicknessrange stated by Swanson and Hopkins of 0.2032 mm to 0.381mm. Even at its thinnest point, which is in the transition Zone,the present invention has a total wall thickness of 0.85 mm(0.20 mm of stainless steel, plus 0.75 mm of PTFE). In theheating Zone of the present invention, the total wall thicknessis 1.50 mm (0.75 mm of stainless steel, plus 0.75 mm ofPTFE).Low Cost, Low-Power Input, High Torque and Speed MotorDesign0.137 Now referring to all the figures: In order to providea 3D printer of relatively low cost, the present inventionemploys relatively low cost stepper motors, also called“microstepper motors' or “microstepper gearmotors' or'stepper gearmotors. By contrast, at the present time othertypes of 3D printers use “NEMA 17” motors or similar hybridstyle motors. Such motors are typically used because theyhave adequate power (500 g-cm or more torque) and speed(180 revolutions per minute) or more, with a minimum ofbacklash at the motor shaft, and motor life of thousands ortens of thousands of hours. However, such motors have relatively high costs, and even higher motor driver costs, controlboard heat dissipation costs, and relatively high power Supplycosts. They also take a relatively large space (over 30 mm perdimension) and have a relatively large weight. As a result,such motors (“NEMA 17” and similar hybrid style motors)are severely limiting for the application of a low-cost, lowpower 3D printer. As an alternative, one 3D printer uses aservomotor design, which includes a DC motor and anencoder for position feedback. However, these motors cangenerate a lot of noise, are expensive, have different systemdynamics which increase costs and limit printing capabilities,do not output as much holding torque or low-speed torque asa stepper motor of the same size, and can have limited lifespancompared to stepper motors.0.138. The smaller motors are necessary in order to maintain the space efficiency of the present invention. In the baseof the printer, which holds motorZ 133 and motorY 134,enlarging the motors would result in either a reduction in printVolume or a larger printer with the same print Volume dimensions. The Smaller motors are especially important in theUS 2016/0236409 A1extruder, where space is severely limited. Increasing the sizeof motorX 833 and/or motorE 835 would require a largerextruder cover 871. The size of the extruder directly relates tothe print Volume, so a motor size increase in the extruderresults in losses in the print volume in the X, Y, and/or Zdirections.0.139. Therefore, to maintain the object of the invention,which is to make a low cost, low-power3D printer, the presentinvention provides a new kind of micro stepper motor. Themicro stepper motors of the present invention are preferablyof the same design. They are an improvement on existingmicro stepper motors (style BYJ, or BYHJ) which are currently used in positioning or motion systems for Scanners, IPweb cameras, air conditioner louvers, and paper feeders. Asthey are used in the prior and present art, these motors aretypically used as a single-direction motor because they aregeared highly to provide enough force, which results in abacklash of about 3-10 degrees. These motors have a gearboxcoupled directly to them, which is essential to achieve thedesired output forces, which typically require 500-5000 g-cmof torque. Thus, the mini stepper gearmotors of the prior arthave a resistance of 30-300 ohms per motor winding, aretypically geared 1:10 to 1:200, and most can only move atmost 60 revolutions per minute (RPM). These characteristicsare very far from those needed for a 3D printer of reasonableperformance and when combined with backlash have beencompletely prohibitive for the application as a rapid movinggantry element. Moreover, the motors of the prior art are mostoften configured as unipolar, which reduces the cost andcomplexity of control electronics, but further reduces themotor torque. Thus the motors of the prior art are only used invery low power, slow moving, single direction, high torqueapplications.0140. In the present invention, a micro stepper motor isshown having completely different characteristics than theprior art. Using the same basic principles of the prior art as astarting point, the present invention provides a micro steppermotor with gearing. However, combined with electronic control and omnidirectional position feedback sensing, thepresent invention has substantially eliminated the problem ofbacklash, made the motors several times faster, made themotors output several times more torque, and eliminated theproblem of overheating when motor winding resistance islowered. The motors of the prior art, which are well knownand can readily be researched and purchased online, are available in 1:16 gearing and are run at 5V to obtain a maximumholding torque of 150g-cm and a max speed of 25 RPM. Withthe modifications of the present invention in place, tests haveproved that the present invention motors can achieve over 460g-cm holding torque and max speed of 200 RPM with asimilar size motor with the same gearing. This equates totripling the holding torque of the motors of the prior art andincreasing the max speed by a factor of eight.0141. The motors of the present invention are micro stepper motors with gear reduction. Typically they are of the“24BYJ48 type design, though they may be varied to havetheir gearing actuated at a distance instead of having an integrated gearbox. The motor will have a size of 8-35 mmdiameter and about the same dimension range in height. Thegear ratios vary from 1:4 to about 1:128. To increase the speedand torque of the motors, the motors should be in a bipolartwo-phase winding configuration. The resistance of eachphase of the motor should be between 0.5 ohms and 30 ohms.For low-noise applications, resistances near 30 ohms are preAug. 18, 2016ferred. In instances where the maximum amount of power isneeded, the resistance of each of the phases should be closerto 0.5 ohms.0142. As a result of using the techniques of the presentinvention, the inventors have greatly improved the characteristics of micro stepper gear motors, making them suitable foruse in many types of applications that were previously notpossible.Motor Electronic Control System for Maintain PowerConsumption Levels0.143 To address the issue of motors overheating overalldue to the higher current consumption, the present inventionprovides firmware and electronics on the onboard electroniccontrol board 111, which meters current. The present invention uses the fact that at high speeds, the motors internalresistance increases due to back EMF and inductance limitmaximum current. In order to achieve maximum speed atreasonable torque, the motor electronics must have no currentlimiting. However, at lower speeds, current would increasedramatically, causing the motor windings to overheat. Therefore, the motors of the present invention must be coupled to acontrol system which can reduces the current Supplied to eachof the motor windings at slower speeds, maintaining torqueacross these varying and lower motor speeds, providing lowerpower consumption, and reducing heating at slow speeds.When calibrated, the motor and control system of the presentinvention can maintain a lower motor operating temperaturewhile providing unprecedented motor speed and torque froma Small package.Motor Backlash Compensation System Design0144. To address the issue of microstepper gearmotorshaving 3-10 degrees of backlash, others have provided antibackslash springs and follower systems (two coupledmotors). However the inventors have found in reduction topractice that these systems do not solve the problem fully, andthey create excessive wear on the motors in one direction,causing premature failure of the sensitive motor gears. Theyalso create excess force in one direction and limit force in theother direction, necessitating more powerful motors. In addition, the amount of force needed in follower and spring systems can change over time, due to wearing of components inthe system.0145 The present invention provides a novel system solution to Solving backlash in microstepper gearmotors. Themotor control electronics in electronic control board 111 hasfirmware written into it that provides backlash compensation.This solution is relatively complex, having to take intoaccount that 1) backlash varies differently in each dimension,possibly due to asymmetries in gear profiles during production and/or other factors, and 2) the backlash can differ bybatch, over time due by the amount of internal motor wear,and over time as external shaft friction changes. It wouldtherefore be impossible to create a one-time backlash calibration, and a symmetric backlash adjustment would not be asideal as using one number for each direction on each axis. Thepresent invention provides a low-cost position feedback sensing element 859 (“backlash detection sensor 859) whichwhen coupled with backlash compensation firmware canrecalibrate the backlash prevention at any interval—thiscould be one-time calibration in the factory, monthly calibrations, calibrations before or after each 3D printed model isUS 2016/0236409 A1made, or evenin real-time when printing is performed. All thebacklash calibrations can be performed independent of userfeedback (such as before each print) or it can be initiated by auser on demand.0146 The backlash detection sensor of the present invention uses the sensor 859 which is an accelerometer or vibration detection Switch to sense jerk or acceleration when theextruder assembly 5 is moved in the X,Y, or Z direction. Thesensor 859 is preferably placed inside the extruder assemblyitself. The force detection is in the range of 0.1 to 10 standardgravity's (“gs'). The electronic control board 111 sendsmotion pulses to the stepper motors, and the backlash sensorof the present invention detects if there is motion, and even theintensity of the motion. For example, 10 stepper motor movement signal may be sent, microstepping a motor for a total of0.3 mm of motion, the entirety of which may result in Zerotravel movement due to backlash in this example. On the 11"pulse, a significant jump in motion can be detected as backlash may have been overcome, and upon Successive pulses thefeedback signal intensity may reach a maximum or plateau.This information can be used to detect the exact distance ofbacklash needed for recovery from backlash and in eachdirection based on calibrations of the motor output shaft sizeto determine the exact amount of backlash that a motor pulsesignal correlates with. This can be repeated on each axis, andfor both directions of motions in the XY and Z directions. Thecalibration procedure can be repeated multiple times, and themedian result can be taken to eliminate noise from outsideforces.0147 In an alternative embodiment, 3D printer 1 comprises of X, Y, and/or Z axis linear guide rails containing aproximity sensor for detecting relative displacement. Thisproximity sensor could be an optical encoder or capacitivedisplacement sensor. A standard calibration could set the Zerolocations of the printer and measure backlash as a one-timecalibration in the factory, a series of monthly calibrations,and/or calibrations before or after each 3D printed model ismade. While the 3D printer is in motion, feedback from thesensor could be sent to electronics control board 111 to givethe location of the printer. Backlash could be detected andcompensated for by measuring the actual distance traveledafter a command is sent that tells the printer to move a specified amount. The difference between the specified travel distance and actual travel distance would be the amount of thebacklash that the backlash compensation firmware mustaccount for.Motor Z-Level Sensor and Bed Planarity Calibration Design0148. In addition the same sensor 859 may be used toreplace the need for endstops which ordinarily determine thelimits of the gantry, by sensing motor stalling indirectly whenmotors crash into the X,Y, or Zlimits of the print volume. Thesame sensor 859, or a tiltsensor, may also be used to level theZgantry, and in addition can be used as a bed leveling system.Bed leveling is a critical problem with the prior art of 3Dprinting, because without a level bed, often within 0.05 mmtolerance, 3D prints can start poorly, warp, deform, or evenlift off the bed, frustrating the user. The backlash detectionsensor 859 of the present invention can be used to “Crash” thenozzle into the print bed 151, detecting the crash jerk ordeacceleration, or it can be used to direct motor vibrationfrom afar. For example, motors in the printer casing. Such asmotorY 134 and motorZ 133, could be turn on maximumcurrent to generate vibration signals, or a vibration elementAug. 18, 2016could be placed inside the printer body to allow this detectionto occur. When the sensor 859 is not touching the 3D printbed, it will detect a lower vibration signal than when it is indirect contact with the print bed coupled through mechanicalstructure to a vibration generating source, allowing a point ofcontact level determination. This Z level detection can berepeated on at least 3 points on the plane of the print bed todetermine its planarity, and the firmware on the electroniccontrol board 111 would adjust the print to compensate for anon-leveled print bed plane (relative to the gantry XY plane).The same system may detect the Zlevel of the print bed at theprint start location.0149. Of note, the print bed and autocalibration and motorsystems of the present invention are a significant improvement on the prior art. Bed leveling systems are often manualand require great efforts to maintain. For example, in the priorart screws are used to level a print bed, and due to vibration inthe motors, the screw loosens and causes the level to changerepeatedly during usage. In the present invention, the use ofmicroStepper motors and lower power consumption dramatically reduces vibration and noise, which helps to maintain thelevel oralignment of system components such as the printbedand gantry. In addition, the printer of the present inventionuses mainly Snap fits, which also ensure that the positions ofcomponents are held rigid and do not change overtime.Significantly Improved Print Qualities0150. The inventors have also found that as a result ofthese detailed calibration procedures, the present inventioncan achieve more Smooth and accurate 3D printed modelsthan high-end 3D printers of the prior art. This may bebecause the printers of the prior art assume that without a gearreducer or gearbox there is minimum backlash, and the problem is ignored. However, the 3D printers of the prior art oftenhave 0.05 to 0.2 mm backlash due to flex in components ortension in timing belts, and this backlash can increase dramatically over usage as there is no backlash compensation inthese systems. Thus the present invention represents a significant improvement on the prior art in that it recognizes backlash as an initial and increasing problem during usage andprovides means for compensating for this backlash, greatlyimproving both 3D print accuracy and useful 3D printer lifetime.Novel Zero-Power Print Bed Design0151. In the prior art, 3D print beds use glass and a heatingelement to promote adhesion of the first layer of ABS to aprint bed. In some prior art embodiments, a PCB is used toprovide anchor holes that are filled by the 3D printer, and inother embodiments glue or solvent dissolved ABS is appliedto a print bed to promote adhesion of the first print layer.These prior art solutions can be inconsistent, frustrating to theuser, messy, and/or consume power. The present inventionand the following discussion is not limited to ABS however,and this may be interchangeable with other plastics such asPLA or nylon or polypropylene for example.0152 The present invention provides a zero power printbed solution. It use an ABS print bed with 0-30% glass or fiberor particle filling. This allows the initial layer of 3D prints tostick to the ABS bed, with the strength of the bond beingdetermined by: (1) the orientation of the 3D printed plasticversus the orientation of the ABS polymer chains in the ABSprint bed, (2) the temperature of the printed extrusion, (3) theUS 2016/0236409 A1distance between the printed extrusion and the print bed, (4)the amount of glass or particle filling in the ABS print bed, and(5) the amount of glass or particle filling in the ABS filamentbeing printed.0153 Uniquely, the present invention provides that sincethe print bed can be “leveled with software corrections tounprecedented accuracy, down to 0.05 mm, and more ideallybelow 0.025 mm, that the print layer distance can beadequately controlled (i.e. Zlayer distance control) with agreater degree of accuracy than the prior art. This allows theprinter of the present invention to print an initial ABS layerthat Sticks to a pure ABS printbed strongly, but not so stronglythat it cannot be removed post printing. The ABS is mostideally printed as a 0.1 to 0.2 mm thick layer with a nozzledistance of 0.1 mm to 0.2 mm thickness and an error of lessthan 0.05 mm standard deviation in layer height and an actualplastic extrusion temperature of about 200-230 degrees C.The present invention also provides a unique provision for theuse of the 100% ABS print bed as described overusage. As theprint bed is used, the Surface layer is consumed and becomesa rougher Surface that is also more compatible with the exactpolymer that the 3D printer uses, because the print bed surface and plastic extrusion are mixed at the interface, andseparated at the end of 3D prints. Therefore, the 3D print bedmust have its initial layer height increased approximately0.025 mm per print up to as much as a 0.2 mm increase tocompensate for the increase in bonding strength of the ABSprint bed surface. After several dozen or hundred prints, theprint bed may be flipped over to provide a fresh surface, or anew print bed may be used, whereby the user needs to indicatethis fact to the control software and/or electronic controlboard 111 to reset the initial layer height distance.Novel Zero-Power Print Bed and/or Filament ComponentDesign0154) In addition the present invention may use a print bedwith at least 5% glass filling to promote the preservation ofthe ABS print bed through usage and limit (or eliminate) theincrease in initial layer height required to maintain consistentprint bed and plastic extrusion bonding. ABS plastic may beincreased to as much as 50% filler concentration when thefibers are long and oriented, such as with glass filling, as isknown in the art. In addition, higher concentrations of glassfilling assist in maintaining the rigidity of print beds, to prevent the 3D printed model from warping the bed during usage.A small amount of TiO2 (titanium dioxide) powder filling canalso achieve the desired effect. For example, the addition of1% or 5%. TiO2 to the ABS print bed (instead of glass fibers)and prevent bonding and wear of the ABS print bed. In addition, 0.025%-1%TiO2 may be added to plastic filaments, andmore ideally 0.05-0.25% TiO2 may be added to the plasticfilaments to prevent their bonding to a print bed. This alsopromoted better removal of support from 3D printed models.In addition, 0.5%-5% pigments, including thermochromicpigments may be added to the plastic filaments to preventthem from bonding to the print bed. The print bed of thepresent invention may be connected to the internal bodyframe 102 using magnets in the print bed or printerframe, andmagnets or metal in the opposite component.Reduced Noise Emissions0155. In order to create a quieter 3D printer, such as onesuitable for an office or school environment, the prior artteaches towards using large enclosures to completely containthe 3D printer and muffle the noise generated by said 3DAug. 18, 2016printer. The prior art teaches away from using an open encloSure in cases when noise emissions must be kept to a miniU0156 The present invention has drastically lower noiseemissions than the prior art. However, this is not due to theinclusion of an enclosure that seals off the Sound generated bythe 3D printer. Although such an enclosure would furtherreduce the noise emissions of the present invention, thepresent invention is already Suitably quiet enough for use in alow-noise environment because it does not generate loudsounds. In a quiet office with 37-38 dB of noise, noise emissions from the present invention were measured while thepresent invention constructed a 3D printed model. At sixinches from the extruder 5 on 3D printer 1, the noise emissions measured 39-58 dB. At three feet away from 3D printer1, the noise emissions measured 38-43 dB. Finally, at six feetaway from 3D printer 1, the noise emissions measured around37-40 dB.0157. The primary contributing factor for the reducednoise emissions are the low-power micro stepper motors.These motors generate considerably less noise than theNEMA 17 stepper motors used in the prior art. In addition,while the printer itself has an open design so users can easilyaccess their 3D printed models, all of the motors are contained within enclosed spaces to further reduce noise emisS1O.S.0158 While the micro stepper motors may be the primarycontributing factor for the reduced noise emissions, there areother hardware design elements which also contribute to thelow-noise design. The low-power heater and nozzle designsdo not necessitate large, powerful fans or multiple fans, asseen in the prior art. Instead, a single 25mm fan 829 suppliesthe extruder 5 with enough cooling power without contributing high noise levels.0159. The printer frame and motion control for the X, Y,and Z axes are also relatively silent. Low-friction linearguides (X guide rod 552,Y guide rod 551) dampen vibrationsand allow for practically silent movement on the X and Y axeswhen coupled with the polymer linear bearings (left slider533, right slider 534, and motorXhousing 801). Likewise, theZ axis threaded rods (Z. rod 501 and motorZ rod 502) movesilently through the polymer threads in front gantry Support531 and reargantry support 532. In addition, the Zbelt 521,Ybelt 522, and both upper gantry belts 523 transmit motion topolymer pulleys with minimal noise produced. Along the Xaxis, motion is transferred through a rack 553 and pinion gear821 system. Metal rack and pinion systems are known forgenerating large amount of noise from the teeth chatteringagainst each other, but the present invention uses nylon 66 asthe material for both rack 553 and pinion gear 821 to reducethe amount of noise generated. Overall, the rigidity of theprinter frame (base frame 101, internal body frame 102, andtop frame 103) contributes to the reduction of noise-inducingvibrations throughout the 3D printer 1 as a 3D model isprinted. In all cases, the coupling of components made ofrigid materials (such as motors and steel threaded rods) withvibration-dampening materials (such as carbon fiber andpolymers) allows for an overall reduction in noise emissions.0160 High quality prints are also the result of reducing theresonance of the upper gantry system 4 and extruder 5. Muchof the prior art uses large, rigid, and heavy components thatcreate vibrations when a motion-axis changes directionquickly (while printing a 3D printed model). These directionchanges, which are frequent as the extruder follows the preUS 2016/0236409 A1determined motion path, generate vibrations that can result inpoor quality 3D printed models.0161 The use of light-weight micro stepper motors, typically 20-40 g per motor, means that the extruder 5 (whichcontains both a motor for the X axis movement and thefilament extrusion) only weighs up to 150 g. NEMA 17 stepper motors in the prior art weigh anywhere from 150 to 500g,and are typically over 200 g. Using motors of the prior art, itis physically impossible to design an extruder that weighsunder 150 g and contains two NEMA 17 motors. As a result,3D printers of the prior art either have an excessively heavyextruder, which causes undesired vibrations during the printing process, or the motion-axis motor and/or filament extrusion motor are not located on the extruder. In both cases, theprint quality is lowered. Moving the X axis motor means morebacklash can be induced on along the X axis and moving theextrusion motor forces the printer to use the less-desirable“Bowden-style” extruder—one where the extruder motorpushes the thin strand of filament through filament tube 120,rather than pulling on it. The present invention uses anextruder that weighs 125 g, contains one motor for filamentextrusion, and contains a second motor for movement alongone axis.0162 To further reduce resonance and create high-quality3D printed models, the present invention uses materials thatdampen vibrations. The use of a polymer, such as nylon 66 orPOM, as the material for connecting parts of the upper gantry4, including front gantry Support 531, rear gantry Support 532,left slider 533, and right slider 534, greatly reduces vibrations. This is explained in the section Reduced Noise Emissions, where these vibrations are regarded as a negative aspectof a 3D printer because of the noise they produce. In addition,the use of carbon fiber for the construction of X guide rods552 and Y guide rods 551 further improves the quality of 3Dprinted models. Carbon fiber allows for greater energy dissipation in a vibratory system, while still exhibiting the highstiffness necessary to keep the extruder stabilized.0163 The invention being thus described, it will be evident that the same may be varied in many ways by a routineerin the applicable arts. Such variations are not to be regarded asa departure from the spirit and scope of the invention and allsuch modifications are intended to be included within theScope of the claims.What is claimed is:1.
