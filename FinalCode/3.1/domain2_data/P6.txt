Field of the Description0002 The present invention relates, in general, to fabrication of three dimensional (3D) objects, and, more particularly,to a 3D printer adapted to print a 3D object of a digital modelhaving overhanging or cantilevered elements without a needfor printing Support structures for the overhanging or cantilevered elements.0003 2. Relevant Background0004 Presently, 3D printing is a fabrication technology inwhich objects (or “printed 3D objects”) are created from adigital file, which may be generated from Software such as acomputer aided design (CAD) program or another 3D modeling program or with a 3D scanner to copy an existing objectthat provides input to a 3D modeling program. To prepare thedigital file for printing, Software that is provided on a printerinterfacing computer or running on the 3D printer itself slicesor divides the 3D model into hundreds-to-thousands of horiZontal layers. Typically, only the outer wall or “shell' isprinted to be solid such that a shell thickness may be definedas part of modifying the 3D model for use in printing. Then,during printing, the shell is printed as a solid element whilethe interior portions of the 3D object are printed in a honeycomb or another infill design, e.g., to reduce the amount ofmaterial that has to be printed to provide the printed 3Dobject.0005. When the prepared digital file of the 3D object isuploaded into the 3D printer, the 3D printer creates or printsthe object layer-by-layer on a build plate or build platform.The 3D printer reads every slice (or 2D image) from the 3Dmodel and proceeds to create the 3D object by laying down(or printing) Successive layers of material on an upper, planarsurface of the build plate until the entire object is created.Each of these layers can be seen as a thinly sliced horizontalcross section of the eventually completed or printed 3Dobject.0006. One of the more common 3D printer technologiesuses fused deposition modeling (FDM) or, more generally,fused filament fabrication (FFF). FDM printers work by usinga plastic filament (e.g., acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS)or polylactic acid (PLA) provided as strands of filament thatis 1 to 3 millimeters in diameter) that is unwound from a spoolmounted onto the printerhousing. The plastic filament is usedto Supply material to a print head with an extrusion nozzle,e.g., a gear pulls the filament off the spool and into theextrusion nozzle. The extrusion nozzle is adapted to turn itsflow on and off. The extrusion nozzle (or an upstream portionof the print head) is heated to melt the plastic filament as it ispassed into the extrusion nozzle so that it liquefies. The extrusion nozzle deposits the liquefied material in ultra fine lines,e.g., in lines that are about 0.1 millimeters across.0007. The extrusion head and its outlet are moved, in bothhorizontal and Vertical directions to complete or print eachlayer of the 3D model, by a numerically controlled mechanism that is operated by control software running on the 3Dprinter, e.g., a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software package adapted for use with the 3D printer. The buildplate is typically stationary with its upper planar Surfaceparallel to a horizontal plane (or horizontal to the nozzle or itsprinted layers). If the build plate is moved at all, it is onlyMar. 10, 2016moved up and down vertically (i.e., in the z-direction). Theextruded melted or liquefied material quickly solidifies toform a layer (and to seal together layers of the 3D object), andthe extrusion noZZle is then moved vertically prior to startingthe printing of the next layer. This process is repeated until alllayers of the 3D object have been printed.0008. A problem with existing 3D printing techniques isthe need for printing a Support structure for any overhanging(or cantilevered) components of a 3D object. For example, afigurine of a human-like character may have its arms extending outward from its body or torso, and the arms would becantilevered out from the body or overhang from the adjacentportions of the body. A support structure would have to beincluded in layers that are printed below or in advance of theoverhanging components or portions of the 3D object toprovide material upon which to print the overhanging components. This slows the printing process further as a significant amount of material may have to be printed to provide theSupport structure, which can waste a large amount of material(e.g., plastic filament).0009. Additionally, upon completion of printing, the 3Dobject requires finishing including removal of the Supportstructure and, in some cases, Sanding or polishing of thesurfaces from which the support structure was removed tomatch the finish of adjacent Surfaces. These additional stepsalso increase the production time of the 3D object and typically must be performed manually, which further increasesfabrication costs and complexities.0010 Hence, it would be desirable to provide a 3D printing method, and associated 3D printer, that can print a 3Dobject without the need to print support structures for eachoverhanging or cantilevered element or portion of the 3Dobject.SUMMARY0011 A3D printer, and print method carried out by the 3Dprinter, is described that allows a 3D object to be printedwithout printing additional support structure. The 3D printerincludes a build plate that is Supported upon a tilt adjustmentmechanism (or printangle-defining mechanism or assembly).The tilt adjustment mechanism or assembly acts to orient thebuild plate's upper Surface relative to a print nozzle (e.g., anextrusion noZZle or other deposition mechanism outlet) Suchthat existing model structure or previously printed/depositedlayers or 3D object material is directly below the print nozzle.0012. The tilt adjustment mechanism may take the form ofa multi-degree of freedom motion system Such as a Stewart'splatform or another useful form for selectively changing theangle of the upper surface of the build plate by tilting orrotating the plate about one axis or about two axes. In oneembodiment, the tilt adjustment assembly includes a rotatingor rotatable build plate and one or more motors for adjustingthe angular orientation of the build plate (e.g., a tilt motor forrotating or tilting the build plate about a tilt axis and, optionally, a yaw motor for orienting the plate with yaw movements).0013 More particularly, an apparatus or 3D printer is provided for generating (or “printing) a physical three dimensional (3D) object without the need for printing support structure for overhanging or cantilevered portions of the 3D object.The 3D printer includes a print head with a nozzle for extruding print material (e.g., ejecting liquefied or melted plastic).The 3D printer also includes a build plate with an upperSurface receiving the print material extruded from the nozzle,US 2016/006.7740 A1whereby the 3D object is formed on the upper surface of thebuild plate. Further, the 3D printer includes a tilt adjustmentmechanism (or print angle-defining assembly) Supporting thebuild plate and tilting the build plate about at least one axis toorient the upper surface and the 3D object relative to thenoZZle during the extruding of the print material from theprint head.0014. In some embodiments, after a first layer of the printmaterial is extruded upon the upper Surface, the tilting isperformed such that a previously extruded portion of the printmaterial is vertically aligned with the nozzle to receive theprint material extruded to forman overhanging element of the3D object. In the same or other embodiments, during theextruding of the print material from the nozzle, the tilting setsa tilt angle of the build plate to a plurality of differing anglesin the range of 0 to 60 degrees as measured between a horiZontal plane and the upper Surface. In other cases, the tiltangle may be even larger Such as in the range of 0 to 75degrees or more.0015. In some implementations, the 3D printer mayinclude a print controller operating the print head and the tiltadjustment mechanism (e.g., with tilt control signals) toextrude the print material from the nozzle in a plurality oflayers defined in a print model of the 3D object with each ofthe layers having a plurality of print locations. The tiltingprovided to the build plate to orient the upper surface isdefined for each of the print locations in each of the layers.The print model may include an overhanging element of the3D object, and the tilting can be defined to position the printmaterial of a previously extruded one of the layers verticallybelow the nozzle during the printing of portions of the layersassociated with the overhanging element. In this way, noadditional support structure is provided for the 3D objectduring the extruding of the print material.0016. In some cases, the tilt adjustment mechanism isconfigured to provide multi-degree of motion of the buildplate during the tilting, and, particularly, the tilt adjustmentmechanism can be configured as a Stewart platform. In othercases, the build plate may be provided as a rotatable disk, andthe tilt adjustment mechanism can then be configured to tiltthe rotatable disk about a tilt axis to orient the upper surfacerelative to the nozzle during the extruding of the print material. Further, the tilt adjustment mechanism can be configuredto provide yaw movement of the build plate during the tiltingto orient the upper surface relative to the nozzle.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS0017 FIG. 1 is a functional block diagram of a 3D printerwith a build plate that is angularly oriented or tilted (on 1 axisor 2 axes) during its use or operation to print or create a 3Dobject without the need for printing a Support structure;0018 FIG. 2 is a flow diagram for a method of fabricatingor printing a 3D object without printing Support materialunder overhanging portions using a 3D printer of the presentdescription such as the 3D printer of FIG. 1;0019 FIG. 3 is a partial side view of a conventional 3Dprinter printing a 3D object with overhanging portions orfeatures by printing additional or Support material in eachlayer to Support the material on a horizontal build plate Surface;0020 FIG. 4 is a side perspective view of a 3D printer ofthe present description during its operation to print a 3Dobject without printing additional Support structure for overhanging portions or features in upper layers;Mar. 10, 20160021 FIG. 5 is an enlarged (or detail) partial side view ofthe 3D printer of FIG. 4 showing features of one embodimentof a tilt mechanism (or plate positioning assembly) operatingto orient or tilt the upper surface of the build plate at apredefined angle to position previously printed layers ormaterial of the 3D object below the print nozzle (or heatedextrusion nozzle);(0022 FIG. 6 a top perspective view of the 3D printer ofFIGS. 4 and 5 showing use of the 3D printer to print an outershell and in-fill portions of the 3D object without printingadditional Support structure;(0023 FIG. 7 illustrates a front view another exemplary 3Dprinter of the present description showing use of a tilt mechanism or build plate positioning assembly with a rotating/rotatable build plate that can also be tilted to provide a desiredangular orientation relative to a print nozzle;(0024 FIG. 8 is a side view of the 3D printer of FIG. 7showing more details of the tilt mechanism; and(0025 FIG. 9 is a detailed front view of the 3D printer ofFIGS. 7 and 8.DETAILED DESCRIPTION0026. The inventors recognized that existing or conventional 3D printers, such as FFF-based 3D printers, areextremely slow in printing a 3D object. Further, conventional3D printers require that support structure must be printed forany overhanging portions of the 3D object, which furtherslows the printing process and requires post-printing fabrication steps to remove the support structure.0027. To address these and other issues with conventional3D printers, a 3D printer is taught that is adapted to constantlyreposition the build plate (or its planar upper surface) relativeto the print material outlet of the 3D printer (e.g., relative tothe extrusion or print nozzle in a fused filament fabrication(FFF) printer). Briefly, the build plate and a partially formed3D object on the upper surface of the build plate are tilted orangularly oriented relative to the print nozzle Such that previously printed and hardened material in lower print layers isvertically and/or directly below the print nozzle as it prints ata next location. In other words, the partially formed or printed3D object may have its overhanging element verticallyaligned with the nozzle when new material is applied to the3D object to grow or further print the overhanging element.(0028 FIG. 1 illustrates a 3D print system 100 configuredto allow an operator to print 3D objects, such as object 170,that may have overhanging elements or portions 176 but thatcan be formed without the need for printing additional Support structure for these elements/portions (i.e., no supportstructure is shown below (or between the plate 113 and theelements 176) the overhanging elements or portions 176). Asshown, the system 100 includes a 3D printer 110 and a printerinterface system 150. The printerinterface system 150 may bea desktop computer, a workstation, a laptop or pad computer,or other computer device operable by a user of the 3D printer110 to select and transmit a digital model 169 to the 3D printer110 for use in printing a 3D object 170. To this end, the printerinterface system 150 includes a processor or central processing unit (CPU) 152 that operates or manages input and output(I/O) devices 154 Such as a monitor, a touchscreen, a mouse,a keyboard, speakers, Voice recognition devices, and the likethat allow an operator or user of the system 150 to provideuser input.(0029 Particularly, the printer interface system 150 mayinclude memory devices or data storage components (e.g.,US 2016/006.7740 A1computer readable medium) 160 (or have access to suchmemory devices) that are managed by the processor 152 tostore one or more digital files 162 that are used to print a 3Dobject 170. Also, the system 150 may use the CPU 152 toexecute code or software (in computer readable medium Suchas RAM, ROM, or the like on the system 150) in the form ofa 3D printer interface program 156. The interface program156 may be downloaded onto the system 150 to allow anoperator to interact with the 3D printer 110 and its printcontroller 130, and the 3D printer 110 may provide this software/program 156 upon a first link of the system 150 and the3D printer 110 or the software/program 156 may be downloaded separately (e.g., by inserting a CD into the system 150,by accessing a web site associated with the 3D printer 110, orthe like).0030. In practice, the 3D printer interface program 156may be adapted to cause a series of interface Screens to bepresented by the system 150 and the I/O devices 154 to a user.The user may select a 3D object for printing by first generating a 3D model 164 of a 3D object, and this definition mayalso include setting a thickness for an outer shell of object 170and a structural infill (e.g., one or more honeycomb patterns).Significantly, the 3D object model 164 may include a plurality of object elements or portions 166, and one or more ofthese object elements or portions 166 may be fully, or have aportion that is, overhanging or cantilevered relative to otherportions that are fully supported by lower layers or portions ofthe 3D object. The 3D printer 110 is configured to allow theseoverhanging portions of the object elements 166 or the overhanging elements 166 to be printed without printing additional support structure that would have to later be removedfrom the 3D object 170 (as was the case with prior3D printerwith build plates that were always in a horizontal position).0031. During operation of the system 100, the printerinterface system 150 functions to communicate (wirelessly orin a wired manner) with the 3D printer 110 including transmitting a digital model 169 (or sending the digital file 162) tothe 3D printer 110 for use by the print control program 134 toprint a 3D object 170 (in other cases, the print control program134 accesses the digital file 162 in the memory 160, as neededfor printing, rather than transmitting the model 169 to the 3Dprinter).0032. The 3D printer 110 includes a build plate or printbed 112 with an upper or exposed planar surface 113 uponwhich melted plastic is printed from a print head 114 to forma 3D object 170. The object 170 has a first or base element orportion 172 that may be printed first upon the surface 113 ofthe build plate 112. Even with conventional 3D printers thisportion 172 does not require a support structure such that thebuild plate 112 may be maintained in a horizontal position(i.e., with planar upper surface 113 parallel to a horizontalplane or parallel to horizontal). Additionally, the object 170has a second or upper element orportion 174 that is Supportedby the first or base element or portion 172, and, again, thematerial of this second element 174 would not require anadditional support structure even with a conventional 3Dprinter such that the surface 113 of build plate 112 may beretained in a horizontal position (as shown).0033. However, the object 170 also includes a third element or portion 175 that is overhanging or cantilevered fromthe second or upper element or portion. If a conventional 3Dprinter were used to print the object 170, an additional supportstructure would have to be printed prior to printing the element 176. Hence, the 3D printer 110 is adapted to tilt or adjustMar. 10, 2016the print angle of the surface 113, as shown with arrows 149showing multi-degree of freedom movement of the plate 113and its upper Surface 113, in an ongoing manner during extrusion of melted filament 122 through the nozzle 116.0034) To this end, the 3D printer 110 includes a tilt adjustment (or print angle-adjusting) mechanism 111 that acts tosupport the build plate 112 and to adjust or change the tilt orprint angle of the upper surface 113 such that material inlower layers (or previously printed layers) is always positioned vertically below the next print position or location. Inthe example shown in FIG. 1, the tilt adjustment mechanism111 would move 149 the build plate 112 so as to tilt thesurface 113 and the in-process object 170 so that printedmaterial in the layers of first or base element 172 and/or ofsecond or upper element 174 are vertically below the nozzle116 to provide Support for the material in overhanging element 176 (or its layers), without the need for additional Support structure. This may involve adjusting the tilt angle, asmeasured between the surface 113 and horizontal, on a nearlycontinuous manner or on a print location-by-print locationbasis. The tilting may be performed along one axis or twoaxes to provide the desired tilt adjustments. The tilt adjustment mechanism 111 may take a variety of forms to implement the 3D printer 110 by providing a build plate 112 with anupper print surface 113 that can be selectively moved withmulti-degree of freedom motion so as to move Support material in the object 170 vertically below the nozzle 116 and itspointed tip/outlet 118. Several examples of useful tilt adjustment mechanisms are described herein, but those skilled inthe art will recognize that other mechanisms or assembliesmay be used to provide the functionality described herein.0035. The 3D printer 110 includes a print head 114 with aheated extrusion nozzle 116 with a pointed tip/outlet 118from which liquid plastic is ejected or extruded to buildup theobject 170 layer-by-layer. In some cases, the heated extrusionnozzle 116 may include a heater or heat coil about a tubewhile in other cases a heated chamber is provided immediately upstream of the tip/outlet 118 to liquefy or melt plasticto prior to extrusion. Further, the 3D printer 110 includes aprint material Supply in the form of a Supply spool 120 uponwhich is wrapped or wound a length of plastic that can bedrawn as shown by arrow 123 into the extrusion nozzle 116where it is melted or liquefied by a heater. For example, thefilament 122 may take the form of ABS, PLA, or other plasticuseful in 3D printing.0036. The 3D printer 110 includes a controller 130 forinterfacing with the printer interface system 150 so as to printa 3D object 170 based on the digital file 162. The controller130 includes a processor 132 executing or running software/code in the form of a print control program 134 (e.g., code incomputer readable media accessible by the CPU 132). Theprint control program 134 is configured to selectively causethe filament 122 to be drawn (e.g., with gearing or the like)123 from the spool 120 into the head 114 while also selectively moving 149 the build plate 112 to provide supportmaterial for printed material using previously printed orlower layers of the object 170. The print control program 134also may operate to move the print head 114 withina layer andto a new layer to print the 3D object 170 (e.g., to provide 3Dprinting, layer-by-layer as is known by those skilled in the artof 3D printing).0037 To provide support below all layers of the objecteven in the cantilevered or overhanging elements 176, theprint control program 134 is designed to cause the controllerUS 2016/006.7740 A1130 to transmit tilt control signals 148 to the tilt mechanism111 that cause it to either retain the present tilt of the uppersurface 113 or to adjust its angle or tilt by reorienting 149 thebuild plate, which may involve tilting the plate relative to oneor more axes. The tilt control signals 148 are typically basedon print parameters that are generated and/or calculated priorto printing by processing the digital model 169. For example,the digital model 169 of the 3D object 164 may be processedby the print control program (or another program in the system 100) 134 to slice the model 169 into a plurality of layersand for each layer head movements 142 may be defined toallow the 3D object to be printed layer-by-layer. The headmovements 142 may be stored in memory or data storage ofthe printer 110 (or stored in another memory device accessible by the print control program 134 during printing).0038. Further, for each print position or location in eachlayer, the print control program 134 can determine whether ornot there is Support material in a lower or previously printedlayer. If there is support material, such as for all the layers ofbase 172 and for the second or upper element 174 of object170, the print control program 134 can determine the surface113 can remain horizontal (or have its tilt angle unchanged),and the plate print angle 144 associated with that print location can be stored in the memory 140 (e.g., at each X-Ycoordinate of each print layer a tilt angle or printangle or plateorientation will be defined by the print control program 134).If there is no Support material provided at a print location in alayer if the plate surface 113 were left in the horizontal position, the print control program 134 determines a tilt or printangle needed to place Support material from a lower or priorprint layer (or adjacent portion) of the 3D object below thepresent print location. The tilt or print angle 144 is also storedin memory 140 for this print location. This process is repeatedfor each layer and each print location in each layer.0039. The print control program 134 further acts to generate a set of plate tilt commands 146 that are designed for thespecific implementation of the tilt adjustment mechanism 111to cause it to orient 149 the build plate 112 at each printlocation in each layer so as to provide Support material belowthe outlet 118 of the heated nozzle 116. The head movements142 are used to generate head positioning signals 135 whilethe corresponding plate tilt commands 146 are used to generate tilt control signals 148 that are transmitted to the tiltadjustment mechanism 111 during the printing of the 3Dobject 170. In this manner, the build plate 112 is orientedand/or positioned as shown with arrows 149 prior to eachdeposition or printing step performed by the 3D printer 110 toensure a previously printed portion of the object 170 is belowthe outlet 118 prior to extrusion of the print filament 122.0040 FIG. 2 illustrates a 3D printing method 200 that maybe performed according to the present description Such as byoperation of the system 100 of FIG. 1 or the 3D printersshown in FIGS. 3-9. The method 200 starts at 205 Such as withcommunicatively linking a printer interface system/computerwith a 3D printer. At 210, the method 200 includes generatingor retrieving a 3D model of the target object, which mayinvolve generating the digital file 162 with the printer interface system 150 of FIG. 1 as discussed above. The method200 then continues at 220 with transmitting a digital filedefining this 3D model, such as file 169, to a 3D printer, suchas printer 110, for use in printing a 3D object0041 At step 224, the method 200 continues with using3D print control software (such as program 134) to the 3Dmodel to define the print layers. This step 224 may involveMar. 10, 2016using a slicer or similar program to define a plurality of thinslices of the model to print sequentially with a 3D printer(such as an FFM printer) or layer-by-layer. Each layerincludes a number of print locations (or Voxels that maycorrespond with X-Y coordinates) where the 3D printer willbe used (and positioned) to deposit a Volume of liquid plasticto form the layer. The method 200 continues at 230 with adetermination of whether there are additional layers to proCCSS,0042. If yes, the method 200 continues at 240 with determining at a next print location whether or not there is (or willbe during actual printing operations) support material provided by a previously printed portion of the model (e.g., alower or previously printed layer). If at 244, support materialis found the method 200 continues at 250 with generating a tiltcontrol signal to orient the build plate parallel to the horizontal plane. Ifat 244 Support material is absent in the print modelfor the current print location or voxel, the method 200 continues at 260 with generating a tilt control signal to orient ortilt the build plate to an angle(s) to provide Support materialunder the print location. In contrast to prior 3D printingmethods, the “support material' is provided using material tobe printed at other locations and/or in other layers such as theimmediately previous print layer. The method 200 then continues at 266 with determining whether or not there are additional print locations or material that needs to be printed in thecurrent print layer. If yes, the method 200 continues at 240with determining the presence or absence of support materialfor the next print location. If no, the method 200 continues at230 with determining whether or not there are additionallayers to be processed for Support material and tilt angles inthe digital model.0043. Once all layers have been processed through steps240-266, the method 200 continues at 270 with retrieving alayer definition from the print control file in memory. Thelayer definition includes a tilt control signal for each printlocation for controlling a tilt adjustment mechanism to orientan upper or print surface of a build plate. This may involverotating the tilt plate about a single axis. In other cases, theplate may be moved with multi-degree of freedom motion toorient the build plate and an in-process 3D object relative toan outlet of a print nozzle (e.g., place Support material for thenext print location vertically below the nozzles outlet). Instep 274, print material or filament is drawn into the printhead, and, in step 278, the material is heated to melt or liquefyto allow deposition via the nozzle.0044. In step 280, the method 200 continues with positioning the print head sequentially at each print location in theprint layer (and/or moving the surface of the build plate relative to the print head). Concurrently, at each print location ofthe print layer, the build plate is tilted or left in its prior printangle (e.g., retained parallel to horizontal) to assure that Support material is provided below the outlet of the print nozzle(e.g., previously deposited or extruded material is alignedwith a vertical axis passing through the outlet Such that gravity causes the extruded material to land upon the previouslydeposited or extruded material of the 3D object). At 284, themethod 200 determines after a layer is fully printed whetheror not there are additional layers to be printed in the printmodel. If not, the method 200 ends at 290, and, if more layersneed to be printed, the method 200 continues at 270 withretrieving a next layer definition.004.5 FIG. 3 illustrates a conventional 3D printer 300during its use to print a 3D object 350. The 3D printer 300US 2016/006.7740 A1includes a housing or Support frame 310 upon which a printhead positioning and Support assembly 320 is mounted. Aprint head 330 is included that can be positioned (e.g., atparticular X-Y print coordinates in each print layer) by operation of the assembly 320 during print operations. The printhead 330 may bean FFM print head that heats plastic filamentthat is then extruded from a print nozzle 334 onto an uppersurface 342 of a build plate 340.0046. In this printer 300, the build plate 340 is stationarywith the surface 342 retained in a horizontal position asshown with its longitudinal axis (or a plane extending throughsurface 342)392 being perpendicular to vertical or a verticalaxis/plane 390. In other printers, the build plate 340 may bemoved along the vertical axis 390 as each layer is printed, butthe surface 342 is horizontally oriented as the plate 340 ismoved vertically up and down.0047. In this conventional printer 300, support materialmust be printed for any overhanging or cantilevered portionsof a printed object. In the example of FIG. 3, the 3D object350 includes a first or base portion or element 352 that may beformed by printing a plurality of layers. The object 350 alsoincludes a second or upper portion or element 354 that overhangs from the base element 352. To print the object 350,therefore, the 3D printer 300 is operated to print additionalmaterial to provide a support structure 360 underneath orvertically below the overhanging element 354. The supportstructure 360 is printed beginning with the initial layers alongwith the layers of the first or base element 352, and, uponcompletion of printing, the additional material of the supportstructure 360 has to be removed with additional fabricationprocesses, which may include Sanding, polishing, and painting. The printing of the Support structure 360 significantlyincreases the length of time required to print the 3D object350 with the 3D printer.0048 FIGS. 4-6 illustrate a 3D printer 400 configured toone embodiment of the description to perform 3D printingwithout the need for printing an additional Support structurefor overhanging elements of a 3D object. The 3D printer 400includes a housing or Support frame 410 upon which a printhead Support and positioning assembly 420 is mounted. Aprint head 430, such as an FFM print head, is provided in the3D printer 400 and, during operations of the 3D printer, theassembly 420 is used to position a print nozzle (or its outlet)434 in numerous print locations as may be defined for each ofa large number of print layers for a modeled 3D object. Printmaterial 438 is drawn into the print head 430 and heated toprovide liquid material that can be extruded from the printnozzle 434.0049. The 3D printer 400 also includes a build plate 440with an upper Surface or print Surface 444 that is facing orexposed to the print nozzle 434. The upper surface 444 maybe planar as shown, but this is not required to practice the 3Dprinter 400. Significantly, the 3D printer 400 also includes atilt adjustment or print angle-defining mechanism 460 thatfunctions to orient the build plate 440 such that the uppersurface 444 is positioned as shown with arrow 570 in a rangeofprintangles, 0, to position previously printed material fromlower layers of the object 450 vertically below the printnoZZle 434. The print angle, 0, in this case is measuredbetween horizontal and a plane extending through the print orupper surface 444 of the build plate 440. The mechanism 460may rotate the plate 440 about more than one axis, though, toprovide multi-degree of freedom motion as shown witharrows 569, which may be useful in providing support mateMar. 10, 2016rial for some shapes or designs of overhanging elements (orportions of such overhanging elements).0050. As shown, the 3D object 450 being printed withprinter 400 has a base or first portion or element 452 and alsoan overhanging or second portion or element 454. No additional Support structure is being printed as shown in FIG. 4-6to print the overhanging element 454 with the build plate 440instead being oriented or tilted by the tilt adjustment mechanism 460 to place previously printed portions (or layers) ofthe 3D object 450 vertically below the print nozzle. To thisend, the mechanism 460 may take the form of a Stewartplatform as shown. Particularly, the mechanism 460 includesa base 462 and six linear actuators 466 pivotally attached at afirst end to the base 462 and at a second end to couplings 568on the build plate 440.0051. By selective actuation as shown with arrows 467,the length of the actuators 466 can be set or adjusted by a printcontroller of the 3D printer (not shown in FIG. 4 but as maytake the form of controller 130 shown in FIG. 1) to move asshown at 569 and 570 to orient the upper surface 444 asneeded to make sure a previously printed portion of the 3Dobject 450 is always below the print nozzle 434. For example,the tilt angle, 0, of the surface 444 may be set for each printlocation of each print layer of the print object 450. In thismanner, as shown in FIG. 6, the 3D object 450 can be printedwithout support material including the base 452 and the overhanging element 454, which may be printed as an outer shell651 and an in-fill 653. Each layer of the object 450 would beprinted location by location (or Voxel by voxel), and, as discussed with reference to FIGS. 1 and 2, a tilt angle (or, moregenerally, a build plate orientation) is defined for each of theseprint locations and the print controller transmits control signals to the mechanism 460 to actuate (set the lengths of) theactuators 466 to orient the upper surface 444 to match thepredefined build plate orientation (or tilt angle(s)).0052 FIGS. 7-9 illustrate another embodiment of a 3Dprinter 700 that operates to print 3D objects such as object 750without the need for printing additional Support structures.The 3D printer 700 includes a housing or support frame witha print head Support assembly 720 for Supporting and selectively positioning a print head 730. A supply filament 738 isused to provide print material to the print head 730, whichheats and extrudes it in liquid form via a print nozzle 734. Theassembly 720 may be controlled by a print controller (asshown in FIG. 1) to position the nozzle 734 of the print headfor printing layers of a print object 750, such as by moving todiffering X-Y coordinates.0053. The 3D printer 700 also includes an assembly 760that is configured to position a print Surface (i.e., upper orprint surface 772 of a build plate 770) and an in-process 3Dobject 750 at a desired orientation relative to the print nozzle734 to ensure new material is always printed on top of previously printed material. To this end, the assembly 760 includesa base or platform 762 that may be stationary or as shown inFIG.8 with arrows 863 may moved vertically up and down(along a Z-axis) by Vertical positioning devices 861 coupledwith the housing or support frame 710 of the 3D printer 700.In this printer 700, the print head 730 may not be raised andlowered (e.g., the print nozzle 734 remains in a single horiZontal plane and the movements 863 are used to move theprint surface 772 and its in-process 3D object relative to theprint nozzle 734 to print the object’s layers).0054 The assembly 760 also includes a pivotal mountassembly (or tilt mount/bracket(s)) 764 that pivotally couplesUS 2016/006.7740 A1the build plate 770 to the base or platform 762. The build plate770 may be a rotating or rotatable disc that can be selectivelyrotated by a print controller to rotate as shown with arrow 774about a center vertical axis to position the 3D object 750relative to the print nozzle 734. Further, the 3D printer 700 isadapted for printing overhanging portions of modeled objectswithout the need for additional support structures. Forexample, the 3D object 750 is shown to include a base or firstelement 752 that could be printed on a horizontal plate without support structure, but the object 750 also includes anoverhanging element 754.0055 To print the overhanging element 754, the assembly760 includes a tilt motor 766 that can be controlled by a printcontroller of the printer 700 to rotation as shown with arrows868 the build plate 770 about a tilt axis 767 extending throughthe assembly 764. Such tilting or rotating 868 causes the tilt orprint angle, B, of the upper surface 772 of the build plate 770(as measured between the horizontal and the upper Surface772) to be adjusted from 0 degrees (or parallel to horizontal)to a desired print angle that helps to place previously printedportions of the 3D object (in-process part) under the printnozzle 734 as can be seen in FIG.8. In addition to this degreeof motion (tilting about tilt axis 767), the assembly 760 mayalso include a yaw motor or actuator 768 that is coupled to theassembly 764 and/or build plate 770 and operable by a printcontroller to cause the build plate 770 to selectively yaw,which may be useful to orient the upper surface 772 and the3D object 750 upon this surface 772 to vertically align previously printed material of the object 750 below the printnoZZle 734 during printing of the overhanging upper element754.0056. As discussed with reference to FIGS. 1 and 2, thepositions (including tilt angle(s)) for the surface 772 relativeto the print nozzle 734 may be defined for each print locationof each print layer for the 3D object, and a print controller ofthe 3D printer 700 may use these definitions to provide a setof control signals to the tilt motors/actuators 766,768 to movethe build plate 770 about one or more axes to orient the uppersurface 772 to provide material of a lower or earlier-printedlayer of the object 750 below the nozzle 734 (i.e., to have theprint location and material of a prior layer aligned with avertical axis of the print nozzle 734).0057 Although the invention has been described and illustrated with a certain degree of particularity, it is understoodthat the present disclosure has been made only by way ofexample, and that numerous changes in the combination andarrangement of parts can be resorted to by those skilled in theart without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, as hereinafter claimed.We claim:1.
