This application is a continuation of InternationalPatent Application No. PCT/KR2015/004567, filed on May7, 2015, which designates the United States and claimspriority of Korean Patent Application No. 10-20140054142, filed on May 7, 2014, the entire contents of whichare incorporated herein by reference.FIELD OF THE INVENTION0002 The present invention relates to a 3D printer.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION0003. A 3D printer of using a photocurable liquid resinbuilds a desired object by adding unit cured layers corresponding to respective cross-sections layer upon layer. Eachof the unit cured layers is cured by image light emitted to thephotocurable liquid resin.0004 Such a photocurable liquid resin is filled or storedin a resin tank, and varied in fluidity depending on temperature. Therefore, in seasons or environments where ambienttemperature is low, the liquid resin may be not properlySupplied to a building Surface to thereby make printingquality deteriorate. Further, the liquid resin may be partiallycured due to storage conditions, scattered light in a printingprocess, etc. and thus float in the liquid resin. By the way,Such a floating impurity decreases the fluidity of the liquidresin, thereby lowering the printing quality.0005. As a curing reaction progresses, impurities increaseand thus viscosity of the liquid resin changes. Like this,since the composition ratio of the liquid resin is changed,there is a need of replenishing the liquid resin. However, aconventional 3D printer is manually replenished with aliquid resin, and therefore has to be always monitored by aworker. In some cases, the liquid resin may be not replenished at an appropriate time, and a printed object may bedefective.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONTechnical Problem0006. The present invention is conceived to solve theforegoing problems, and an aspect of the present inventionis to provide a 3D printer which increases fluidity of a liquidresin and removes floating impurities, thereby improvingquality of a printed object.0007 Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a 3D printer which is automatically replenished with aliquid resin.Technical Solution0008. In accordance with an embodiment of the presentinvention, a 3D printer includes: a resin container which isfilled with a photocurable liquid resin; a circulating pipewhich forms a circulating channel through which the liquidresin is drained out of the resin container and then returnedto the resin container, a circulating pump which circulatesthe liquid resin in the circulating channel; a heating unitwhich heats the liquid resin; and a filter which filters outimpurities from the liquid resin in the circulating channel.Feb. 23, 20170009. The 3D printer may further comprise a temperaturesensor which measures a temperature of the liquid resin; anda controller which controls the heating unit to heat the liquidresin if it is determined based on a temperature signal fromthe temperature sensor that the temperature of the liquidresin is lower than a predetermined lower limit temperature.Thus, it is possible to keep the temperature of the liquid resinhigher than a predetermined temperature.0010. The heating unit may comprise a heating chamberfor accommodating the liquid resin drained out of the resincontainer, a heater for heating the liquid resin in the heatingchamber, and an agitator for stirring the liquid resin in theheating chamber. With this, it is possible to improve an effectof heating the liquid resin.0011. In accordance with an embodiment of the presentinvention, the 3D printer may further comprise: a replenishing tank which stores a replenishing liquid resin; areplenishing pipe which connects the liquid resin in thereplenishing tank to the circulating pipe; and a selectionvalve which selects one of the replenishing liquid resin fromthe replenishing pipe and the liquid resin drained out of theresin container to be supplied to the resin container.0012. The 3D printer may further comprise: a levelsensor which measures a level of the liquid resin in the resincontainer; and a controller which controls the selection valveand the circulating pump to replenish the resin containerwith the replenishing liquid resin in the replenishing tank ifit is determined based on a level signal of the level sensorthat the level of the liquid resin in the resin container is lowerthan a predetermined proper set level. Thus, the replenishingliquid resin in the replenishing tank is automatically Supplied to the resin container in accordance with the level ofthe liquid resin in the resin container.0013 The selection valve may be provided upstream ofthe heating unit and the filter; the 3D printer may furthercomprise a bypass pipe which bypasses the heating unit andthe filter; and the selection valve may select the liquid resinto be Supplied to the resin container by bypassing the heatingunit and the filter through the bypass pipe. Thus, it ispossible to circulate the liquid resin or the replenishingliquid resin in more various methods.Advantageous Effects0014. According to the present invention, there is provided a 3D printer which increases fluidity of a liquid resinand removes floating impurities, thereby improving qualityof a printed object.(0015. Further, there is provided a 3D printer which isautomatically replenished with a liquid resin.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS0016 FIG. 1 is a conceptual view of a 3D printer according to an embodiment of the present invention,0017 FIG. 2 is a conceptual view of a 3D printer according to another embodiment of the present invention,0018 FIG. 3 is a conceptual view of a 3D printer according to still another embodiment of the present invention,0019 FIG. 4 is a conceptual view of a 3D printer according to yet another embodiment of the present invention, and(0020 FIG. 5 is a control block diagram of the 3D printeraccording to the present invention.US 2017/0050389 A1DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THEINVENTION0021 Below, embodiments of a 3D printer (100), (200),(300) according to the present invention will be describedwith reference to accompanying drawings.0022 FIG. 1 is a conceptual view of a 3D printer (100)according to an embodiment of the present invention. Asshown in FIG. 1, the 3D printer (100) includes a resincontainer (30) filled with a photocurable liquid resin (10),and an optical engine (60) placed below and spaced apartfrom the resin container (30). For convenience of description, it is illustrated that the optical engine (60) is placedbelow the resin container (30). Alternatively, the opticalengine (60) may be placed above the resin container (30).0023. As shown in FIG. 1, the resin container (30)includes a bottom plate made of an approximately transparent material, and a building plate (40) for Supporting aprinted object (50) is arranged above the resin container(30). With this structure, image light is emitted from theoptical engine (60) to the liquid resin (10) in the resincontainer (30) via the bottom plate of the resin container(30). The liquid resin (10) exposed to the image light iscured on the building plate (40). When one layer is completely cured, a building plate driver (70) drives the buildingplate (40) to move up and then stop while leaving a space forbuilding the next cured layer. Then, image light for acorresponding cross-section is emitted for a curing process.As a process of moving up the building plate (40) and acuring process of emitting the image light are repeated, a 3Dsolid printed object (50) is completed.0024. The resin container (30) is provided with a circulating pipe (110). The circulating pipe (110) forms a circulating channel (150) through which the liquid resin (10) isdrained, circulated and then returned to the resin container(30). Such circulation of the liquid resin (10) is achieved byan operation of a circulating pump (120) arranged on thecirculating channel (150).0025. The circulating pipe (110) includes a first endconnected to an outlet (32) through which the liquid resin(10) is drained out of the resin container (30), and a secondend connected to an inlet (34) through which the circulatedliquid resin (10) is returned to the resin container (30). Ingeneral, the outlet (32) is arranged at an upper portion of theresin container (30) so as to be level with the liquid resin(10), and the inlet (34) is arranged opposite to the outlet (32)at a lower portion of the resin container (30).0026. With this, floaters, which are substantially flowingon a surface of the liquid resin (10), are easily drained outof the resin container (30) via the outlet (32). Further, it ispossible to minimize the fluidity of the liquid resin (10) inthe resin container (30) even though the liquid resin (10) iscirculated and then returned to the resin container (30), sincethe inlet (34) is placed at the lower portion of the resincontainer (30). The heights and positions of the outlet (32)and the inlet (34) may be properly selected in accordancewith the structure of the resin container (30), the level of theliquid resin (10), etc. As necessary, a plurality of outlets andinlets may be provided at a plurality of positions in the resincontainer.0027. The circulating channel (150) is provided with aheating unit (130), and the heating unit (130) includes aheating chamber, a heater, and an agitator. The heating unit(130) makes the liquid resin (10) drained out of the resincontainer (30) be accommodated in the heating chamber andFeb. 23, 2017heated by the heater. Further, the liquid resin (10) is stirredby the agitator while being heated, and thus a heatingefficiency increases.0028. With this, the heating unit (130) heats the liquidresin (10) circulating in the circulating channel (150), andthus lowers the viscosity of the liquid resin (10). In general,when the temperature of the liquid resin (10) is lower thana predetermined value, the fluidity is too low to circulate.Further, the liquid resin (10) is slowly spread out or biasedlySupplied on a building Surface during the curing process,thereby lowering the quality of the printed object (50).(0029. Thus, the 3D printer (100) according to the presetinvention employs the heating unit (130) to keep the temperature of the liquid resin (10) constant and thus increasethe fluidity of the liquid resin (10), thereby making the liquidresin (10) Smoothly circulate and improving the quality ofthe printed object (50). In this embodiment, the heating unit(130) is provided in the circulating channel (150), but notlimited thereto. Alternatively, the heating unit may be provided in the resin container (30).0030. On the circulating channel (150), a filter (140) isarranged downstream of the heating unit (130). The filter(140) may be made of a filtering net, a filtering clot, etc. andinclude a single filtering material or a combination of pluralfiltering materials in accordance with various conditionssuch as the size of particle sizes to be filtered, the propertiesof the liquid resin (10), precision of a printed object, desiredquality, etc. With this, the filter (140) removes cured orpartially-cured floaters from the liquid resin (10). Thus, theliquid resin (10), which is heated by the heating unit (130)and of which impurities are filtered out through the filter(140), is returned to the resin container (30) by the circulating pump.0031 FIG. 2 is a conceptual view of a 3D printer (200)according to another embodiment of the present invention.The 3D printer (200) shown in FIG. 2 includes basically thesame elements as that of FIG. 1, and further includes areplenishing tank (260) for Supplying a replenishing liquidresin (13) to a circulating pipe (210).0032. As shown in FIG. 2, the replenishing tank (260) isarranged downstream of a heating unit (230) and a filter(240) and connected to the circulating pipe (210) via areplenishing pipe (270). The replenishing pipe (270) and thecirculating pipe (210) may be connected by a three-wayselection value (280), and thus the replenishing liquid resin(13) is selectively supplied through this selection valve(280) when needed.0033. In addition, the replenishing tank (260) may furtherinclude a pump for Smoothly supply the replenishing liquidresin (13). This pump in the replenishing tank (260) mayoperate along with a circulating pump (220) So that thereplenishing liquid resin (13) in the replenishing tank (260)can be smoothly supplied to the resin container (30). Withthis structure, the 3D printer (200) according to the presentinvention Supplies the replenishing liquid resin (13) to theresin container (30) in accordance with the level of the liquidresin (10), thereby keeping the level of the liquid resin 10constant in the resin container (30).0034 FIG. 3 is a conceptual view of a 3D printer (300)according to still another embodiment of the present invention. The 3D printer (300) shown in FIG. 3 includes basically the same elements as those of FIG. 1 and FIG. 2.However, a selection valve (380) is arranged upstream of aheating unit (330) and a filter (340), and a bypass pipe (390)US 2017/0050389 A1is coupled to the selection valve (380) and bypasses theheating unit (330) and the filter (340). With this structure, the3D printer (300) according to the present invention circulates the liquid resin (10) drained out of the resin container(30) after heating and filtering, or directly supplies the liquidresin (10) again to the resin container (30) via the bypasspipe (390) without heating and filtering.0035. Further, the replenishing liquid resin (13) in thereplenishing tank (360) may be directly supplied to the resincontainer (30) via the bypass pipe (390), or may be suppliedto the resin container (30) after heating and filtering. Likethis, the position of the selection valve (380) is changed andthe bypass pipe (390) is additionally provide, so that theliquid resin (10) can be variously circulated, thereby supplying the liquid resin (10) or the replenishing liquid resin(13) in various methods as necessary.0036. In the foregoing embodiments, a unit printed layeris cured as it is immersed in the liquid resin (10) of the resincontainer (30). In other words, the resin container (30) inthese embodiments also serves as a building work space.Alternatively, the resin container (30) may be independentlyseparated from the building work space.0037 FIG. 4 is a conceptual view of a 3D printer (400)according to yet another embodiment of the present invention, in which the resin container (30) and the building workspace are separated. As shown in FIG.4, the 3D printer (400)includes the resin container (30) placed in a space separatedfrom the optical engine (60) and the optical engine (60). Theresin container (30) is filled with the photocurable liquidresin (10) to be supplied to the building work space, and theliquid resin (10) is supplied to the building work spacethrough a Supplying sheet (401). To Supply the liquid resin(10) to the supplying sheet (401), a sheet driver (402) maybe wound and unwound to move the supplying sheet (401)left and right, or the resin container (30) may directly moveleft and right.0038 If the sheet driver (402) is used to supply the liquidresin (10), a circulating pipe (410), a circulating pump (420),a heating unit (430) and a filter (440) are stationarilyarranged as illustrated in FIGS. 1, 2 and 3. On the otherhand, if the resin container (30) is moved to supply the liquidresin (10), these elements are movable or the circulating pipe(110) is flexible corresponding to the movement of the resincontainer (30). As necessary, the 3D printer (400) accordingto the present invention may further include the replenishingtank (260), (360), the replenishing pipe (270), (370), theselection valve (280), (380) and the bypass pipe (390).0039. In general, the circulation of the liquid resin (10) inthe 3D printer is automatically controlled by a controller(500) even though it is manually controllable by a user.0040 FIG. 5 is a control block diagram of the 3D printer(100), (200), (300), (400) according to the present invention.As shown in FIG. 5, the controller (500) receives signalsabout the temperature and level of the liquid resin (10) in theresin container (30) from a temperature sensor (510) and alevel sensor (520). The temperature sensor (510) generallysenses the temperature of the liquid resin (10) in the resincontainer (30), but may sense the temperature of the liquidresin (10) at a specific position on the circulating channel(150), (250), (350), (450) as necessary.0041. The controller (500) controls the heating unit(130), (230), (330), (430) based on a temperature signalreceived from the temperature sensor (510). For example, ifit is determined that the received temperature signal indiFeb. 23, 2017cates a temperature lower than a predetermined lower limit,the controller (500) controls the heating unit (130), (230),(330), (430) to heat the liquid resin (10). With this, the liquidresin (10) in the resin container (30) and the circulatingchannel (150), (250), (350), (450) is kept to have a temperature equal to or higher than the lower limit, therebyimproving the fluidity of the liquid resin 10 in the resincontainer (30) and the circulating channel (150), (250),(350), (450).0042. Further, the controller (500) controls the resincontainer (30) to be replenished with the replenishing liquidresin (13) of the replenishing tank (260), (360) based on thelevel signal received through the level sensor (520). If it isdetermined based on the level signal about the liquid resin(10) in the resin container (30) that the level of the liquidresin (10) in the resin container (30) is lower than apredetermined proper level, the controller (500) controls theselection valves (280), (380) to supply the replenishingliquid resin (13) from the replenishing tank (260), (360) tothe resin container (30). While the replenishing liquid resin(13) is supplied by the selection valve (280), (380), theliquid resin (10) is not drained out of the resin container (30).Thus, the resin container (30) is rapidly replenished with thereplenishing liquid resin (13), so that the liquid resin (10) inthe resin container (30) can be kept to have a level equal toor higher than the proper level.0043. As described above, the 3D printer according to thepresent invention includes the resin container (30) to befilled with the photocurable liquid resin (10); and the circulating pipe (110), (210), (310), (410) forming the circulating channel (150), (250), (350), (450) through which theliquid resin (10) drained out of the resin container (30) iscirculated and then Supplied again. The circulating channel(150), (250), (350), (450) includes the circulating pump(120), (220), (320), (420) for circulating the liquid resin(10); the heating unit (130), (230), (330), (430) for heatingthe liquid resin (10); and the filter (140), (240), (340), (440)for filtering out cured floaters. In addition, the replenishingtank (260), (360) is connected to one side of the circulatingpipe (110), (210), (310), (410) through the replenishing pipe(270), (370), and selectively supplies the replenishing liquidresin (13) through the selection valve (280), (380). Thiscirculation is controlled by the controller 500. The controller(500) controls the heating unit (130), (230), (330), (430), theselection valve (280), (380) and the circulating pump (120),(220), (320), (420) based on the signals about the temperature and level of the resin container (30), thereby keeping thetemperature and level of the liquid resin (10) of the resincontainer (30) higher than a predetermined temperature andlevel.0044) The scope of the present invention is not limited tothe illustrated embodiments, and is thus applicable to all the3D printers as long as the liquid resin can be circulatedtherein.What is claimed is:1.
