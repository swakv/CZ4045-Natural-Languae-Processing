A 3D printer input includes filaments comprising separated layers or sections . These inputs particularly including fila
ments may be prepared by coextrusion , microlayer coextru
sion or multicomponent / fractal coextrusion . These inputs and specifically filaments enable layering or combining different materials simultaneously through one or more
nozzles during the so - called 3D printing process . These
techniques facilitate smaller layer sizes ( milli , micro , and
nano ) different layer configurations as well as the potential to incorporate materials that would otherwise not be usable
in standard 3D printer methods .
