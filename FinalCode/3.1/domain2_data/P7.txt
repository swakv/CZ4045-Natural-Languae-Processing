S . provisional application Ser . No . 62 / 304 , 366 filed Mar . 7 , 2016 and62 / 304 , 371 filed Mar . 7 , 2016 . The forgoing applications areincorporated by reference herein .FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE[ 0002 ] The present disclosure relates generally to additivemanufacturing . More particularly this disclosure relates to3D printing a 3D printed container and filling the container .BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION[ 0003 ] 3 - D printing is an additive manufacturing processthat builds a part in a layer - by - layer fashion to create athree - dimensional object from a digital model . Initiallydeveloped in the mid 1980 ' s and used subsequently inhighly specialized industries with the expertise and financialmeans to mitigate the high costs , 3 - D printing has recentlybecome a technology that is cheap and accessible to almostanyone . Today ' s 3D printers include room sized systems butare more typically desktop instruments and can be used forcreating and / or prototyping items as disparate as humanorgan replacements and turbine parts .10004 ] Although many materials can be used to make 3Dprinted parts , many materials are difficult or impossible touse as the print feedstock using current 3D printing technology . There therefore is a need for 3D printers andmethods of printing unconventional materials .less of being deposited through the opening ( e . g . , withinabout 1 min or less or within about 10 seconds or less ) theliquid covers the inside bottom of the container and at leasta portion of the inside walls . Also optionally the containerretains its structure integrity while the liquid takes the shapeof the container . For example , the liquid flows into thecontainer and does not leak out of the container . Forexample , less than 50 vol . % ( e . g . , less than 20 vol . % , lessthan 10 vol . % , less than 1 vol . % ) of the liquid is absorbedinto the first food material or leaks out of the container . Insome implementations , the 3D printer surface can beremoved from the 3D printer . For example , the 3D printersurface can be a tray that sits on the stage of the 3D printer .The tray can be held in place , for example , by magneticmeans and / or quick release clasps . In the method , the traycan optionally be removed and cleaned and / or sterilized . Thetray can be made of a food grade material . For example , thetray can be removed by an operator , by means of a conveyor ,and / or a robotic means such as a robotic arm . The methodalso includes removing the tray with the printed part andcuring the part , for example in an oven . Optionally , printingthe first portion of the object comprises extruding the firstfood material through a first nozzle , and also optionallydepositing a liquid comprises extruding the liquid through asecond nozzle . For example , the first and / or second nozzlecan be in fluid communication with a syringe equipped witha linear actuator for depressing the plunger into the barrel ofthe syringe . In some implementations , the first food materialand / or the liquid is extruded through the first and / or secondnozzle using a screw extruder or a progressive cavity pump .Optionally , the method further comprises heating the firstportion of the object prior to depositing the liquid throughthe opening ( e . g . , curing the first portion of the object ) .[ 0007 ] In some implementations the method furtherincludes curing the liquid to form an at least partially curedliquid and / or at least partially curing the first food material .Optionally , curing the liquid to form an at least partiallycured liquid is initiated prior to depositing the liquid throughthe opening of the at least one container ( e . g . , in a nozzle ) .Optionally the container maintains its structural integritywhile the liquid and / or the first food material is cured .Optionally , the first portion of the object does not change itsliquid fillable volume by more than about 50 % during acuring step ( e . g . , by not more than 40 % , by not more than30 % , by not more than 20 % , by not more than 10 % ) .Optionally , the first portion of the object does not change inany dimension during a curing step by more than 50 % ( e . g . ,by not more than 40 % , by not more than 30 % , by not morethan 20 % , by not more than 10 % ) . Optionally , the firstportion of the object does not produce carbon dioxide duringa curing step .[ 0008 ] Optionally , curing is initiated by energy from anenergy source selected from the group consisting of aresistive heater ( e . g . , an oven and / or a heat gun ) , an electrongun , a UV lamp , a visible light lamp , an IR lamp , a chemicalreaction ( e . g . , combustion or another exothermic reaction ) ,a laser , and combinations of these . For example wherein theenergy source directs energy at the liquid and / or the firstfood material . Optionally , curing is initiated and also maintained using the aforementioned energy source ( e . g . , theenergy source optionally may need to be applied continuously to complete the curing process ) . Optionally curingcomprises heating the liquid and / or first food material , forexample using a heat gun , an oven and or a heat lamp . InSUMMARY[ 0005 ] In general , methods equipment and systems aredescribed herein for the production of parts using liquidand / or paste feedstocks . For example , parts are created using3D printers and low viscosity feed materials such as foodbased liquids and pastes , thermoset plastic precursors , thermoplastics and metal containing pastes .[ 0006 ] In accordance with the invention there is provideda method for producing an object using a 3D printer .

The method can also include homogenizing the solidmaterial and the liquid prior to depositing the liquid and thesolid material through the opening of the container . Optionally the first food material has a viscosity greater than about10 , 000 centipoise at room temperature .[ 0011 ] In some implementations the first portion of theobject comprises a particulate material selected from maize ,wheat , potato , rice , buckwheat , barley , spelt , rye , soy , oat ,peanut , almond , coconut , walnut , chestnut , hazelnut , tapioca , garbanzo bean , black bean , arrowroot , amaranth , teff ,sesame seed , sunflower seed , chia seed , flax seed , quinoa ,xanthan gum , guar gum , kamut , millet and mixtures of these .In some implementations the first portion of the objectcomprises at least 1 % ethanol .[ 0012 ] Optionally the liquid includes a monomer which isa precursor to a thermoset plastic .[ 0013 ] Also in accordance with the invention there isprovide a method for producing a part using a 3D printer .The method includes printing a first portion of the part , thefirst portion of the part comprising a thermoplastic , and thefirst portion of the part defining at least one container havinga bottom , walls and an opening . The method also includesdepositing a liquid through the opening of at least one of theat least one container , the liquid being capable of beingcured . The method further includes at least partially curingthe liquid to form an at least partially cured liquid . Themethod also includes depositing a second portion of liquidon the at least partially cured liquid and at least partiallycuring the second portion of the liquid to form a second atleast partially cured liquid .[ 0014 ] Optionally , depositing comprises flowing the liquidthrough a nozzle above the opening while moving the nozzlerelative to the first portion of the part . Also optionally , thecontainer and additional layers of thermoplastic is impermeable to the liquid .[ 0015 ] In some implementations of the method for producing a part , curing comprises providing energy to theliquid .

This limitation is due to the fact thatliquids flow and do not maintain structural integrity eitherunder gravity or under mechanical movements / vibrationsthat may occur during other 3D deposition methods . Notonly does this limitation affect the types of materials that canbe used for 3D printing , it also makes integration / consolidation of different methods of manufacture difficult . Curingor partially curing during the forming / printing process helpsmitigates these issues and is an advantage of the hereindescribed apparatus , systems and methods . Curing or partially curing is also advantages because it speeds up theoverall part production and streamlines part making . Inaddition , printing a container to contain a liquid material andthen curing the liquid also provides a method to print usinglow viscosity materials . Conversely , High viscosity pastessuch as those including metal containing particles and highviscosity silicones can be difficult to use as feedstocks in 3Dprinting . The methods and equipment described herein canbe useful for producing parts using these paste materials . Inthe case of metal containing pastes , further treatment ofprinted parts such as sintering can produce metal parts .10028 ] Other features and advantages of the invention willbe apparent from the following drawings , detailed description , and from the claims .DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS[ 0029 ] The foregoing will be apparent from the followingmore particular description of example embodiments of theinvention , as illustrated in the accompanying drawings .

Lowviscosity liquids have a viscosity of less than about 10 , 000centipoise and can be poured ( e . g . , up to about the consistency of honey at room temperature ) . Medium viscosityliquids have a viscosity between about 10 , 000 centipoiseand about 1 , 000 , 000 centipoise ( e . g . , pastes includingketchup and peanut butter ) and can be extruded with moderate force but cannot be easily poured . High viscosityliquids have viscosity above about 1 , 000 , 000 centipoise andare pastes or putties that cannot be poured ( e . g . , Caulkingcompounds , window putty ) and require high forces to beextruded .[ 0056 ] As used herein , the toughness of a material isdefined as the amount of energy per unit volume that amaterial can absorb before rupturing . The toughness can bedetermined by integration of a stress - strain curve and it is theenergy of mechanical deformation per unit volume prior tofracture .[ 0057 ] As used herein , the resilience of a material is theability of the material to absorb energy when it is deformedelastically and release that energy upon unloading . Themodulus of resilience is the energy absorbed per unit volumeup to the yield point . It can be calculated by integrating thestress - strain curve from zero to the yield point ( e . g . , elasticlimit ) . Under uniaxial tension the resilience can be calculated / expressed as the product of the square of the yieldstress divided by two times the Young ' s modulus of elasticity . Some resilience test protocols include ASTM D2632( Rubber Property , Resilience by Vertical Rebound ) , ASTMD7121 ( Rubber Property , Resilience Using Schob TypeRebound Pendulum ) , and DIN 53512 ( Determination of therebound resilience of rubber ) .[ 0058 ] As used herein , Young ' s Modulus is the slope of astress strain curve for a material in the elastic ( e . g . , linear )region . Young ' s Modulus is the ratio of compressive stressto the longitudinal strain and is an indication of a materialsstiffness . Stiff materials have a higher Young ' s Modulus thana flexible material .[ 0059 ] As used herein , curing is the process of forming atleast one chemical bond between materials such as molecules , solids , particulates , metal - oxide / hydroxide clusters ,proteins and / or polymers in a material . For example , a crosslinking reaction between polymers is a curing process . Asanother example , the polymerization of a monomer is also acuring process . Condensation reactions between aluminosilicates can also be considered curing . Yet another exampleis the processes that can occur during cooking / baking suchas mallard reactions , caramelization and / or protein entanglement . A partially cured material has a subset of the possiblebonds that can formed by fully curing reacted to form abond , e . g . , less than 80 % of the possible bonds that could beformed under fully curing conditions . A fully or substantially cured material has more than about 80 % of thepossible bonds formed , e . g . , the possible bonds are all thebonds that could be formed under the curing conditions .Curing of a materials described herein can increase itsviscosity . It is understood that over - curing can decreaseviscosity since bonds can also be broken under curingconditions .[ 0060 ] As used herein , a food or food material means araw , cooked , or processed edible substance , ice , beverage , oringredient used or intended for use or for sale in whole or in[ 0051 ] Glossary[ 0052 ] As used herein , a liquid fillable volume is thevolume that a non - permeating ideal liquid can fill a container , not including any liquid that spills out of any openingin the container , while the container is in a quiescent stage( e . g . , not under agitation ) and it is not under a compressionforce ( e . g . , it experiences only about 1 g of gravity ) . An idealnon - permeable liquid does not permeate through the container material ( e . g . , does not absorb into its walls ) and doesnot have surface curvature due to adhesion between themolecules of the liquid and the container or cohesion forcesbetween the molecules of the liquid . For example the liquidfillable volume of a water glass would be the maximumamount of water that could be contained in the glass if itwere set on a level surface and not including any decreaseor increase of water volume due to surface tension causingsurface curvature ( e . g . , not including variation due to ameniscus ) .[ 0053 ] As used herein ; x , y and z are Cartesian coordinatepoints . X , Y and Z refer to the Cartesian directions . Clearly ,other coordinate systems can be used by applying theappropriate transfer function , e . g . , to polar coordinates .[ 0054 ] As used herein , CNC control refers to computernumerical control . For example where the motions of amachine are controlled by a prepared program containingcoded alphanumeric data such as G - code . CNC control cancontrol the motion of a print head ( e . g . , nozzle or anextruder ) and stage of a 3D printer relative to each other( e . g . , their relative x , y and z position ) , other energy outputs( e . g . , heating , cooling , and electrical power to a laser ) andspeed of extrusion of a feedstock .US 2017 / 0251713 A1 Sep . 7 , 2017part for human consumption , or chewing gum . A foodingredient can be one or more ingredients that make a foodor food material .[ 0061 ] As used herein , the term “ porosity ” means therelative proportion of the volume of voids . For example , amaterial having a porosity of 20 % means that 20 % of thematerial volume comprises voids ( e . g . spaces , holes , gapsetc . ) .[ 0062 ] As used herein , a linear actuator refers to anactuator that creates motion in a straight linear path .[ 0063 ] As used herein Cermets are composite materials ofceramic and metals . The matrix can be a ceramic material ,such as when there is more ceramic by volume than metaland the metal forms particles embedded in the ceramic .Alternatively , the metal can form the matrix with ceramicparticles embedded therein .EMBODIMENTS[ 0064 ] Using the equipment , methods and systemsdescribed herein , a curable liquid can be used for makingparts . The liquid material can be cured or partially curedduring 3D printing of the part . For example , 3D printers andmethods are described that can be used for printing usingliquids of low , medium and high viscosities . For example ,3D printers are described that can be used for printing usingtwo part epoxies , food pastes , high viscosity silicones andpastes including metal particles .[ 0065 ] FIG . 1 is a pictorial flow diagram showing anembodiment of a method for printing a part . The methodincludes : step A , print a container ; step B , infill the container ; step C , cure the infill ; step D , increase the containersize ; step E , add additional infill ; step F , cure the additionalinfill ; and step G , repeat steps D - F until desired part is made .Details for these steps are outlined below .10066 ] Step A is to print a container . The container is aportion of the final part to be printed . The container isprinted on a surface , such as a stage 10 of a 3D printer ( e . g . ,a 3D printer surface ) . The container is printed by extrudinga liquid or paste material 12 such as a molten material , ( e . g . ,examples of 12 can be a thermoplastic or a food paste )through a first opening such as first nozzle 15 . The materialis deposited onto the platform and / or previously depositedmaterial to build the part . For example if the material is athermoplastic , it can fuse onto the platform or previouslydeposited thermoplastic . The portion of the part , in FIG . 1 isconfigured as circular container with a circular wall 20 andan open top . The bottom of the container 25 is the platform( alternatively it can be a surface made from the extrudedmaterial ) . Preferably , the top of the walls ( e . g . , the top of thewalls are the position closest to the extruding nozzle 15 ) arecoincident with a plane that is parallel to the surface 10 . Itis contemplated that for other embodiments the containercan have walls in any configuration and / or shape and that thepart may be made with more than one container . Thecontainer can be any height ( e . g . , in the Z direction , Z shownin FIG . 1 ) , for example between about 10 microns and about100 cm ( e . g . , between about 10 microns and about 10 cm ,between about 100 microns and about 1 cm , between about100 microns and about 1 mm ) . The dimensions of thecontainer are at least in part determined by the sized of the3D printer . The container defines a liquid fillable volumewhich is this embodiment is the equal to the inner volume( LFV ) of the cylinder :[ 0067 ] LFV = h : tr ? : where h is the height and r is the innerradius .[ 0068 ] Step B is an infilling step . In this step liquid 30 isdeposited in the container through the open top . Depositioncan be done by using a second nozzle 16 although singlenozzle configurations are also possible ( e . g . , where both 20and 30 are deposited from the same nozzle , or 30 is pouredin manually ) . Preferably the amount of liquid used is lessthan or equal to the volume of the container ( e . g . , the liquidfillable volume ) so that the liquid does not overflow out ofthe container . The direction Z is indicated as perpendicularto the stage 10 and is opposite to the direction of gravity ( oran artificial gravity such as could be generated on a spaceship or space station ) . In some other embodiments , fillingcan be done by dipping the entire container into a dippingtank of the liquid and then bringing it out of the tank .[ 0069 ] Step C is a curing step . After infilling , the liquid iscured or at least partially cured . For example the materialcan be cured using an energy depicted as the dotted arrowsin FIG . 1 , produced by device 32 and impinging on thecuring liquid 34 . In some embodiments the device is notneeded as the liquid may be self - curing and / or cures due toexposure to ambient conditions of light , moisture or air .[ 0070 ] Step D prints a second portion of the part andincreases the container volume by adding material to thecontainer walls . Additional material , such as the thermoplastic , is deposited on the surface of the previously deposited thermoplastic at an incrementally higher Z position( e . g . , where higher denotes a direction away from the stage )and in a plane parallel to X and Y . Alternatively or additionally , the thermoplastic can be deposited on the at leastpartially cured liquid . For example , the wall can be angledinwards towards the center of the container making a smallerdiameter wall so that at least some of the thermoplastic isdeposited on the partially cured material . The wall diametercan also be increased so that the wall angles outwards fromthe center of the container . In all cases deposition increasesthe height of the part in the Z direction . The amount ofincrease can be any height , for example between about 10microns and about 100 cm ( e . g . , between about 10 micronsand 10 cm , between about 100 microns and about 1 cm ,between about 100 microns and about 1 mm ) . The increasein height can be the same as the initial height of the portionof the part printed in step A or a different height . Theadditional material can be the same material as used in stepA , or it can be a different material .[ 0071 ] In step E , a second portion of liquid is deposited onthe at least partially cured liquid . The liquid is preferablyadded to just below the top of the newly deposited wall sothat it does not overflow . Alternatively , as in step B the stepcan include dipping the entire container into a dipping tankof liquid and then bringing it out of the dipping tank thusfilling the container above the already at least partially curedliquid . The second portion of liquid can be the same liquidas used in step B or a different liquid .[ 0072 ] The second portion of liquid is at least partiallycured in step F .[ 0073 ] Step G includes repeating the steps of increasingthe container size ( e . g . , with the same or new materials ) ,adding additional infill ( e . g . , with new or the same liquids )and curing the infill . This can be done many times to buildup an entire part . A final step can include closing thecontainer opening by printing a material covering the opening or curing a portion of the curable liquid .US 2017 / 0251713 A1 Sep . 7 , 2017[ 0074 ] In some embodiments the steps described withreference to FIG . 1 can all be done using a single 3D printer .In other embodiments a 3D printing system can includeseveral 3D printers in series where the stage 10 is moved( e . g . , placed and / or conveyed ) after one or more steps . Sucha system can be effective for continuous production of partsand rapid overall production . In this embodiment , each stepcan be at a different location and / or different stations specialized for a specific activity ( e . g . , printing , filling orcuring ) . In such systems bottle neck steps can be optimized( e . g . , the time for these steps can be minimized ) , for exampleif one of the steps is slow , duplicates of equipment at thatstep can be used , e . g . , if curing is slow then several or asingle device 32 can be utilized to irradiate several parts ata time . One example of such a system would be to use thefollowing steps : step Ais done in a first location , a mechanical arm moves the stage to a second location for step B andC , the mechanical arm then moves the stage back to the firstlocation for step D , then back to the second location for stepE and F and then repeating these movements for step G .0075 ] In some embodiments more than one container isproduced in a single part . The containers can be started atany layer in the layer - by - layer deposition of the part . Forexample , FIG . 2 shows a part 205 oriented with a front leftcorner at position ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) and with two spherically shaped atleast partially cured materials therein ; 210 with center atposition ( X1 , Y1 , ) and 220 with center at position ( X2 , 72 ,Z2 ) . The part has dimensions of length L , width W and heightH where : 0 < x , and x2 < L ; 0 < y , and yz < W ; and ( < z ; andz < H . For example , possible coordinates can be x , = 0 . 3 L ,y , = 0 . 5 W and 21 = 0 . 3H and x2 = 0 . 6 L , Y2 = 0 . 5 W , 22 = 0 . 6H ,where the coordinates refer to the center of the depictedspheres . Printing of this part can be in any direction . Forexample , layers in the X Y plane can be printed whileincrementing ( e . g . , segmented or step like movement )upwards in the Z direction . In particular , the direction forincrementing or segmented movement ( e . g . , Z in the above )is preferably in the direction opposite the force of gravity orartificial gravity .0076 ] In some embodiments the nozzle 16 ( FIG . 1 ) isstationary relative to the container while the container isbeing filled . For example , with low viscosity liquids wherethe liquid quickly flows and covers the bottom of thecontainer ( e . g . , within about 5 minutes of less , within about1 min or less or within about 10 seconds or less the liquidcovers the bottom of the container and at least a portion ofthe walls ) and the surface of the liquid opposite the bottomforms a level surface . In other embodiments the nozzlemoves while filling the container . For example the nozzlemoves in an X Y plane in a raster or spiral fashion whileextruding liquid . Moving the nozzle can be useful formedium viscosity liquids that might flow slowly and wouldnot cover the bottom and form a level surface in a reasonableamount of time ( e . g . , about 5 minutes of less , within about1 min or less or within about 10 seconds or less ) if depositedin only one location . Other embodiments include movementof the liquid rather than or in addition to movement of thenozzle to help cover the bottom of the container and form alevel surface . For example , the stage can be vibrated , orsonication can be utilized . Covering the bottom surface andleveling might be also be accomplished by a mechanicalmeans such as a leveling bar , squeegee or a brush .[ 0077 ] In some optional embodiments the deposition ofthe liquid in the container can be by spraying the liquid . Forexample , the liquid can be aerosolized .[ 0078 ] The methods also include producing parts that havevoid volumes between about 5 % and 90 % . For example ,voids can be created in a thermoplastic material so that lessthermoplastic is utilized and the part is printed more quickly .For example , the void volume can be increased by fillingless than all of the chambers if more than one chamber isproduced in the part .[ 0079 ] The first portion of the part can include a thermoplastic . For example the thermoplastic can be selected fromthe group consisting of at least one of acrylonitrile butadienestyrene ( ABS ) , polylactic acid , polyamide , polyethyleneterephthalate , polyurethane , polycarbonate , fluoropolymers( e . g . , polytetrafluoroethylene and polyfluoro vinylidene ) ,polyvinyl chloride , polystyrene , polypropylene , polyphenylene sulfide , polyphenylene oxide , polyethylene ,polyetherimide , polyetherether ketone , polybenzimidazole ,poly ( methyl methacrylate ) , polyamide imide , polysulfone ,polyether sulfone , polythalamide , polybutylene terephthalate , polypropylene terephthalate , polyacetal , polyphthalamide , polyphenylene sulfide , polyvinylidene fluoride , styrene acrylonitrile , styrene maleic anhydride , acylate styreneacrylonitrile , polyesters , cellulose acetate , cellulose acetatebutyrate , cellulose acetate propionate , cellulose nitrate , ethylene vinyl alcohol , ethylene vinyl acetate , ionomer , polyacrylonitrile , and copolymers of these . Some preferredembodiments include combinations of thermoplastics withcomplimentary physical properties , for example one mighthave a high resilience while another have a toughness e . g . ,a Nylon combined with polycarbonate . One may have a highdensity and the other a low density e . g . , polyacetal andpolyethylene . One may be biodegradable while the other isnot e . g . , Polylactic acid and ABS . The thermoplastic can alsobe a food material such as chocolate , caramel , fondant andicing .[ 0080 ] In some embodiments the thermoplastic is selectedto be easy to remove from the at least partially cured liquid .For example the thermoplastic material is soluble in acid ,base or an organic solvent . In another alternative the thermoplastic is brittle and can be shattered easily . For example ,the thermoplastic can be less resilient than the at leastpartially cured liquid .[ 0081 ] In preferred embodiments the container is substantially impermeable to the liquid . For example , the liquid issubstantially impermeable for at least the time it take topartially cure the liquid in curing steps . For example , lessthan 80 vol . % of the liquid passes through or into the wallsof the container ( e . g . , less than 90 vol . % ) . In some embodiments the liquid may change the permeability of the walls ,for example decreasing it by swelling or otherwise reactingwith the wall material and making the walls more impermeable . In some embodiments a sealant is applied to thewalls of the container . For example , a spray containingplastic particulates and / or dissolved plastic ( e . g . , plasticssuch as a thermoplastic ) and a volatile solvent such asacetone , toluene , propane , butane , ethyl 3 - ethoxypropionateand / or aromatic hydrocarbons .[ 0082 ] In some embodiments the first portion of the partcan include a paste or similar material that is extrudedthrough a paste extruder such as a syringe , a peristalticpump , a progressive cavity pump or screw extruder .

In addition , the particles are preferably besmaller than any nozzle through which they are extruded .Some pastes can be made of a food material such as starches ,water and a viscosity modifying agent such as xanthan gum .Other pastes include sugar pastes ( e . g . , also known as gumpaste or sugar gum ) , fondant , marzipan or icing . In someembodiments a volatile liquid can be added to the paste ,such as ethanol between about 1 and 50 vol % ( e . g . , between5 and about 30 vol . % . In some preferred embodiments thepaste can be cured once extruded e . g . , by heat . In someembodiments the paste is bakeable such that it does not burn( e . g . , does not char or become non - edible material ) or melt .In embodiments where the paste is bakeable preferably itcan be heated to up to about 400 degrees Fahrenheit for morethan about 15 minutes ( e . g . , more than about 30 min , morethan about 45 min ) without melting or charring . Preferablythe bakeable material does not change in volume duringbaking by more than about 50 % and more preferably it doesnot change in any volume during baking by more than about20 % . For example , the bakeable paste can be a paste thatdoes form a porous material during baking , e . g . , it does notcontain any ingredients that form carbon dioxide under thecuring / baking conditions or prior to curing / baking ( e . g . , thepaste does not contain carbonates or yeasts ) . In addition ,preferably the paste does not become distorted during theheat treatment . For example , the change in any dimensiondoes not exceed 50 % and more preferably not exceeding20 % . That is , if a part has a wall thickness is 0 . 5 cm and 2cm tall , the part preferably has a wall thickness between 0 . 25cm and 0 . 75 cm and preferably a wall height between 1 cmand 3 cm after heating .

For example the energy , suchas can be provided from device 32 can be thermal energy .For example device 32 can be a heat gun , a resistive heateror a flame . The energy can also be a UV light , visible light ,or IR light . For example 32 can be an IR heat lamp , UVlamp , a visible light lamp , or a visible , IR or UV laser . Theenergy can also include chemical energy . For example , achemical energy that is due to an exothermic reaction fromcross linking reactions in the liquid and / or ring strainrelease . Preferably , during the curing process , the first portion of the part maintains its structural integrity .10084 ] In some embodiments , the liquid comes in two ormore parts . For these embodiments , the methods can includemixing the two or more parts prior to filling the container .Preferably mixing is done by using an in - line mixer such asa static mixer that mixes the liquid just prior to depositing itinto the container . The static mixer is preferably disposable .[ 0085 ] In some preferred embodiments the liquid is athermoset precursor . Optionally the thermoset precursor iscured by adding energy . Optionally the added energy speedsup the curing process . The thermoset precursor can be asingle part thermoset precursor , a two part thermoset precursor or a more than two part thermoset precursor .10086 ) Thermosets can include silicone systems . Forexample room temperature vulcanizing ( RTV ) siliconessuch as tin catalyzed condensation silicones and platinumcatalyzed addition cure silicones . Silicones can be one partRTV systems or two RTV systems . Other silicone systemsinclude high temperature curing systems which can be oneand two part silicones .0087 ] Single part thermosets also include photopolymers .Photopolymer systems can include binders ; monomers ( e . g . ,acrylate , epoxide and urethane monomers ) ; photoinitiators ;plasticizers , stabilizers , nano particles , reactive diluents( e . g . , to form composite resins ) and colorants . For example ,photopolymers that are used in sterolithography can beutilized in the methods and equipment described herein .Binders are reactive molecules of medium molecular weight( e . g . , 100 - 1 , 000 g / mol ) consisting of a few monomer unites( e . g . , dimers , trimers and trimers ) . Photopolymers can consist of between 50 and 80 % of such binders . Binders can bestyrene based such oligomers of styrene - tetramer - alphacumyl and , alpha - methyl styrene oligomers .

Optionally the system is aone part system including a monomer and a catalysts with ahigh barrier to activation . In such a system the catalyst andmonomer are stable for long enough to produce a part . Thepolymerization is initiated by providing thermal energy tothe monomer catalyst mixture deposited in the container ofthe part that is being created .[ 0089 ] Optionally , some ROMP systems are two partsystems with one part including the monomer and thesecond part including the catalyst . For example the catalystcan include a carrier such as a solvent that dissolves orsuspends the catalyst for easy mixing with the monomer .The monomer and catalyst are mixed just prior to filling thecontainer or are mixed in the container ( e . g . , by the movement of the nozzle and or stage ) .US 2017 / 0251713 A1 Sep . 7 , 2017[ 0090 ] Preferably a two part ROMP system is usedwherein , one part includes a monomer and catalyst precursorand the second part includes the monomer and activator .

Bronstedacids such as mineral acids can be used . For examplehydrochloric acid is an effective activator .[ 0094 ] In some embodiments using ROMP systems anactivator is incorporated with the material forming thecontainer such as a thermoplastic . For example , the activatoris added / applied as a coating or compounded with thethermoplastic or material forming the container . The liquidcan then include a single component that contains themonomer and the catalyst .[ 0095 ] Other kinds of liquids can be used in alternativeembodiments . For example , liquids that can be cured to formallyl resins , epoxy resin , melamine formaldehyde , phenolformaldehyde plastic , polyester , polyamide , polycyanurates ,vulcanized rubber , and polyurethane . For example epoxyresins such as bisphenol A epoxy resin , bisphenol F epoxyresin , Novalac epoxy resin , aliphatic epoxy resin and glycidylamine epoxy resin . Liquids can also be used that arecured to form thermosets that are self - healing materials suchas poly ( urea - urethane ) .10096 ] In some alternative embodiments the liquid can bean edible material .

Alternatively , for food based parts , the solids caninclude foods such as nuts and chocolate pieces .[ 0098 ] FIG . 3 is a diagrammatic front cross cut view of a3D printer 300 having two extruders for producing a part ,such as the part described in FIG . 1 and FIG . 2 . For example ,the printer can be used for printing parts using a paste 320as the feed material in one extruder , and a liquid 321 as thefeed in the other extruder . The printer includes a chamber310 capable of containing the paste material 320 . The printeralso includes a second chamber 322 for containing the liquid321 . In this embodiment the chambers operate in a similarUS 2017 / 0251713 A1 Sep . 7 , 2017Therefore , it may require a strong rigid structure made ofmetal ( e . g . , aluminum and / or steel ) .10100 ] FIG . 3 shows one possible configuration for movement using a gantry to move the chamber relative to thestage . The gantry has a carriage 390 that is fastened to thechambers . The carriage can move in the Y direction on rail392 . The rail is fastened to nut 394 which is coupled to screw396 and therefore can move the chamber in the Z direction .Movement of the carriage and screw can be done usingstepper motors coupled to the carriage and screw ( e . g . , directdrive for the screw , through a belt for the carriage ) . The stagecan be moved in the X direction with a second carriage 397and rail 399 . Other configurations include a stage that doesnot move and a gantry with 3 orthogonal rails to move thechamber in X , Y and Z directions are conceived . In theshown embodiment the two chambers move together withthe carriage ( e . g . , they are attached to each other and to thecarriage ) . Alternate embodiments include an independentcarriage and rail for each chamber so that the chambers canmove independently of each other .[ 0101 ] In some preferred embodiments , the printer 300includes an energy source 333 . The energy source can beattached to a chamber and configured to direct energytowards the extruded material . For example , as depicted inFIG . 3 wherein the dotted arrows represent energy directedtowards extruded material . The CNC control can control theoutput of energy to optimize the effect on extruded material .For example , as shown in FIG . 3 , as chamber 310 movesfrom left to right depositing extruded material , energysource 333 in active and provides energy to extruded material .way and only the description for chamber 310 is provided .Embodiments including 1 , 3 , 4 or more chambers are alsoenvisioned and it is understood that similar features asdescribed are applicable to these embodiments . The chamber includes at least one movable wall 330 . The walls can bemade to move by a mechanical device 340 e . g . , a linearactuator with a nut and a screw 342 in mechanical communication with the wall . For example , the wall can be made tomove up and down in the Z direction as indicated by thedouble headed arrow next to screw 342 . The mechanism 340can be controlled by a CNC controlling device 350 such asa computer executing an algorithm . The chamber 310 alsoincludes at least one opening 360 through which material320 can be extruded to produce extruded material 370 . Astage 380 is disposed to receive the extruded material fromthe opening ( e . g . , a first layer of extruded material isdeposited on the stage with subsequent layers deposited onpreviously deposited material ) . The stage can include aheater . The relative position of the stage 380 and the opening360 is controlled by the CNC control . A chamber heater 385is disposed for optionally heating the chamber and materialinside the chamber . The heater can be a silicone mat resistiveheater and includes a thermocouple ( not shown ) for monitoring the temperature . Other embodiments include a hot airgun , an IR lamp , a resistive heater , and combinations ofthese directed at the chamber . In some embodiments theheater is made using a metal block such as aluminum that ismachined to fit around the chamber e . g . , with a hole throughthe metal , and wherein the metal is heated with a cartridgeheater .10099 ] The CNC control communicates with electrical andmechanical devices that control the relative position of thechamber 310 ( e . g . , X1 , Y1 , Zi ) , the stage 380 ( e . g . , X2 , Y2 , Z2 )and the heater 385 temperature . For example , stepper motorscoupled to the stage or chamber through direct screw drives ,belts and or pulleys . Gantries , tracks and other methods ofsmooth movement of the stage and / or chamber relative toeach other in X , Y and Z directions can be used . A preferredalgorithm executes a relative X and Y movement of theopening to the stage while extruding material , followed byan incremental movement up in the Z direction , and followed by deposition of another layer by relative movementin the X and Y directions and extrusion of additionalmaterial . It is understood that this algorithm may includepauses in motion , and motions in any direction , suchmotions can be used to allow inspection , adjustment , modification , or other actions to be performed on the part beingprinted or the apparatus . Pauses can also be for the purposeof curing or partially curing a part . A part is thus built bydeposition in a layer by layer fashion . It is understood thatthe relative movement of the chamber and stage canachieved by many different configurations . For example ,under CNC control and the electrical and mechanicaldevices , the stage may move in the X and Y direction and thechamber moves in a Z direction ; in another configuration thestage may move in a Z direction and the chamber moves inan X and Z direction ; alternatively the stage may move in aY direction while the chamber moves in an X and Zdirection ; in another configuration the stage may not moveand the chamber may move in X , Y and Z directions . Theexact configuration for CNC movement can be selected bythe Artisan . In some embodiments such as depicted in FIG .3 , the chamber can be relatively heavy since it supports allof the feed material for two chambers and linear actuators .[ 0102 ] In preferred embodiments the chamber and movable wall are configured as a syringe , with the barrel of thesyringe defining the chamber and the movable wall being thesurface of the plunger placed inside the barrel . The syringesare therefore the extruders of the printer .[ 0103 ] As previously described , the movable wall 330 canbe moved by means of a linear actuator that is in mechanicalcommunication and / or contact with the wall . For example ,as shown in FIG . 3 , the actuator is in contact on one side ofthe wall while the other side is in contract with the material .Although a screw and nut is depicted in FIG . 3 , any suitablelinear actuator can be utilized . Preferably the linear actuatorcan be selected from the group consisting of a screw and nut ,a pneumatic or hydraulic piston , a solenoid , a wheel and axleor a cam . For example , by rotation of an actuator nut relativeto a screw , the screw can move in and out of the threadedhole in a linear fashion ( e . g . , or the nut moves up or downthe shaft ) . In an alternative , a wheel and axle can be coupledto a belt that is also connected to a rigid shaft and can movethe shaft in a linear fashion . Also , a cam can be used toprovide thrust at the base of a shaft .[ 0104 ] Mechanisms other than a linear actuator are recognized for moving the walls of the chamber . For example ,the Tube - Wringer ( Gill Mechanical Co . , Oregon ) acts bysqueezing two walls of a flexible tube ( e . g . , configured as atoothpaste or caulking tube ) between rollers . Such rollerscould be modified to be driven by a motor and CNCcontrolled . Alternatively , more than one linear actuatorcould be used , for example , pushing on two walls of thechamber , such as opposing sides of a flexible tube .[ 0105 ] FIG . 4 is a diagrammatic cross cut front view ofanother 3D printer 400 for producing a part . For example , apart as described in FIG . 1 and FIG . 2 . The printer includesUS 2017 / 0251713 A1 Sep . 7 , 2017a thermoplastic extruder 410 . The thermoplastic extruderheats thermoplastic filament 412 using heater 413 which isforced through nozzle 414 by rollers 415 or gears coupled toa stepper motor . Molten filament can then be deposited ontostage 416 which is disposed below nozzle 414 . The stage caninclude a heater . The thermoplastic is deposited in a layer bylayer fashion producing a portion of a part 418 defining atleast one container . ( e . g . , the first layer is deposited on thestage and subsequent layers on the previous layer of thermoplastic of the growing part ) . The 3D printer also includesa liquid extruder 420 . In the shown embodiment the liquidextruder includes an in - line mixer 422 and dual reservoirchambers 425 . The in - line mixer receives liquids throughtubes 424 and mixes these liquids as they flow into andthrough the in - line mixer . The tubes are connected ( e . g . , soas to be in fluid communication ) to chambers 425 forcontaining liquids . The chambers each include a movablewall for pressurizing the liquids and forcing the liquidthrough tubes 424 , through static mixer 422 and throughextruder 420 . The liquid , when mixed in 422 , becomes acurable liquid 419 and it is deposited into the containers suchas 421 in part 418 where it can cure at least partially . Thethermoplastic and liquid extruder are attached to a carriage426 . The apparatus includes a computer control system CNCcontrol 430 .[ 0106 ] The CNC control communicates with electrical andmechanical devices that control the relative position of theextruder carriage 426 ( e . g . , X1 , 71 , Zy ) , the stage 416 ( e . g . , X2 ,y2 , Z ) and the heater 413 temperature . For example steppermotors coupled to the extruder carriage through a gantrysystem including rail 432 , nut 434 , direct drive screw 436 ,carriage 438 and rail 440 . In the shown configuration thestage does not move while the extruders are being operated .The CNC control also controls the extrusion speed ofthermoplastic E , and the liquids E2 .[ 0107 ] FIG . 5 is a diagrammatic front cross cut view of a3D printer 500 with a filament and a liquid extruder including a curing device . The printer includes an energy source510 attached to carriage 426 and disposed to direct energy( e . g . , shown as dotted arrows ) at the extruded liquid . Theenergy source is a removable and interchangeable . The typeof energy source selected depends on the kind of curableliquid that is used . For example , if a photo curable polymeris used the energy source can be a UV or visible light / laser .If a heat curable polymer is used then an energy source suchas a resistive heater , a hot air gun or an IR lamp could beappropriately selected . The curable liquid is conveyed to theextruder 420 through a tube 524 , the flow therethroughcontrolled by the CNC control computer 430 . The tube is fedliquid from a reservoir such as a chamber with a movablewall ( not shown ) .[ 0108 ] FIG . 6 is a diagrammatic front cross cut view of a3D printer 600 including an insulating enclosure and heaters . In this embodiment the 3D printer includes a heatedinsulation enclosure for maintaining the extruded materialsat a temperature of at least about 35 degrees Celsius ( e . g . , atleast about 40 degrees Celsius , at least about 50 degreesCelsius , at least about 60 degrees Celsius , at least about 70degrees Celsius , at least about 80 degrees Celsius , at leastabout 90 degrees Celsius , at least about 100 degrees Celsius ,at least about 120 degrees Celsius ) . This can be effective forsome curable liquids such as dicyclopentadiene which havefreezing points around room temperature . The insulatedenclosure can also aid in curing heat curable liquids . Theinsulation is configured as an insulating chamber containingthe stage and part . The chamber also includes heaters 610 .The 3D printer can also include heating elements for tube524 such as a heating tape to maintain the temperature abovethe melting point of the liquid . The heater and insulatedchamber can even maintain temperatures of at least about 35degrees Celsius ( e . g . , at least about 40 degrees Celsius , atleast about 50 degrees Celsius , at least about 60 degreesCelsius , at least about 70 degrees Celsius , at least about 80degrees Celsius , at least about 90 degrees Celsius , at leastabout 100 degrees Celsius , at least about 110 degreesCelsius , at least about 120 degrees Celsius ) .[ 0109 ] In some embodiments , more than one paste ( e . g . ,molten thermoplastic ) or liquid are utilized in creating thepart . For example , ABS and Nylon are used as a thermoplastic . As another example , dicyclopentadiene and a silicone are used to fill the containers . In these embodimentsadditional extruders for the pastes and liquids can be used ,the extruders can be similar to those described herein . Alsoadditional equipment , such as energy sources can be used .For example , a heater and a UV - lamp might be used depending on the liquid used .[ 0110 ] In some embodiments the printing is done under areduced oxygen environment . For example , an environmentthat does not support combustion of any organic regents thatare used such as monomers and polymers . Some reducedoxygen environments include a gas mixture with more than90 % nitrogen , argon , carbon dioxide and or helium ) . Thereduced oxygen environment can be achieved by enclosingthe 3D printer and flushing the enclosure with a gas including nitrogen , argon , carbon dioxide , helium or mixturesthereof . A low oxygen environment can be maintained byrecirculating the atmosphere through a catalyst such as acopper based catalyst . For example , the enclosure can be aglove box . The enclosure can be designed as a part of the 3Dprinter . The enclosure can alternatively or additionally provide a reduced moisture environment such that a dry gasmixture contains less than the saturation amount of water forthe temperature and pressure ( e . g . , less than about 30 gwater / Kg air at 1 atm , less than about 25 g / Kg , less thanabout 20 g / Kg , less than about 15 g / Kg , less than about 10g / Kg , less than about 5 g / kg or less than about 1 g / Kg ) . Thereduced moisture environment can be maintained by flushing the enclosure with a dry gas and / or removing moisturethrough a recirculating drying system ( e . g . , the dryingsystem using molecular sieves ) .[ 0111 ] The methods and equipment described herein areuseful for making a part which is also an embodiment of theinvention . For example a 3D printed part can be configuredas a thermoplastic shell surrounding a core where the core isselected from the group consisting of a thermoset polymerand a composite comprising a thermoset polymer . Forexample , the thermoset polymer can be any one or morethermoset herein described . The part can also include a solidsuch as fiber glass , carbon fibers , wood fibers and othermaterials such as have been described herein . The part canalso have void volumes between about 5 % and 95 % . Thepart can be made in many different configurations , forexample as a component of a vehicle , an airplane component , a body armor component , a mechanical device orcomponent , a medical device or component , a structuralsupport for a building , a micro - mechanical device , a bodyreplacement part or prosthesis , a disposable component or asensor part .US 2017 / 0251713 A1 Sep . 7 , 201713[ 0112 ] FIG . 7 exemplifies another embodiment of a 3Dprinter 700 wherein the movable wall can be the screw of anextruder . For example the screw extruder ( shown as a crosscut view ) has a chamber 710 , containing the screw 720 . Theflights of the screw comprise a moving wall 730 in thechamber . A mechanism for moving the screw ( e . g . , the wall )can be a rotatable shaft 740 , e . g . , rotating in the directionindicated by curved arrow Rz . A drive motor can be coupledto the shaft to have it rotate around its axis ( the drive motoris not shown ) . The rotation speed can be controlled by theCNC controller 350 . The extruder can be continuously feedthrough an extruder ingress 750 , for example where theingress is coupled to a feed - hopper , a syringe , a peristalticpump , a progressive cavity pump or another screw extruder .Other features are the same as indicated in FIG . 3 ; Material320 in the chamber 710 , extruded material 370 , opening 360 ,stage 380 , gantry with carriage 390 , rail 392 , nut 394 , screw396 , rail 399 for the stage , Energy source 333 and carriage397 . A chamber heater can also be included ( not shown ) , forexample , a heating tape can be wrapped around the chamberwall . In some alternate embodiments the 3D printer caninclude multiple extruders ( e . g . , 2 , 3 , 4 or more ) and theextruders can be configured as any of the extruders hereindescribed .[ 0113 ] Any of the openings of the chambers such as 360can be attached to a nozzle . For example , the nozzle can bea removable part with different size outlets . Material is fedinto the nozzle through an inlet and out of the nozzle throughon outlet . In some embodiments two or more chambers ( e . g . ,two screw extruders , two syringe extruders or a screwextruder and a syringe extruder ) are used and each chamberfeeds the material to be extruded through an opening in eachchamber , to the nozzle inlets . Therefore , between the outletof the chambers and the nozzle inlets the two materialscombined prior to being extruded through the nozzle . Thelocation or region where the combination occurs is an in - linemixer . For example , with two chambers , the mixer can be ina “ Y ” - shaped configuration wherein the mixing chamber hastwo inlets connected to the outlets of the chambers and oneoutlet connected to the nozzle inlet . The size of the inlets tothe chamber can be each of different sizes , for example tocontrol the amount of material from each chamber allowedinto the mixing chamber . The chamber can be an elongatedtube , elliptical , rectangular , conical or any other suitableshape . Mechanical mixing such as rotating propellers ,paddles , rotor stators and / or turbines can be used to improvethe mixing . Mechanical stationary means such as a staticmixer can also be used . Preferably , a static in - line mixer isused .[ 0114 ] As previously described the 3D printers can preferably include an energy source directed at the extrudedmaterial . Such an energy source can be useful for curing thematerial . For example , it can be beneficial to cure or partiallycure the material as soon or soon after it is deposited , sincethis will diminish any flow of the material which can distortthe final part . For example , if the material is deposited as atube with a diameter of 1 mm , curing can prevent thediameter from distorting by more than about 10 % ( e . g . , adistortion forming roughly an ellipse with the major axis notgreater than 1 . 1 mm or the minor axis of not smaller than 0 . 9mm ) . As previously described , the energy source can beattached to the chamber or to a structural support for thechamber so that it moves with the chamber and can bedirected to the area where the material is being deposited onthe stage . Alternatively or additionally the energy source canbe attached to the stage and can be configured to directenergy to the deposited material . Alternatively or additionally , the energy source can be independent of the stage andchamber and simply positioned or controlled ( e . g . , controlled by the CNC control ) to direct energy towards thedeposited material . The energy source can also be a UV orvisible light source . A UV or visible light source can be used ,for example , to initiate a photo polymerization . The lightsource can be a laser light , for example , such as is used insterolithography . More diffuse light can also be utilized . Insome embodiments the energy source can be a source thatprovides ionizing radiation , for example , an electron gun .[ 0115 ] The energy source can be a source that providesheat . For example , the energy source can be heat suppliedfrom the stage , for example through resistive heaters . Inaddition , or alternatively the heat can be supplied by a heatgun disposed to blow hot air at the extruded material as it isbeing deposited and / or where it has been deposited . Similarly , the heat source can be from an IR lamp . If the energysource is a source that supplies heat , the 3D printer caninclude insulation . For example , the entire 3D printer including the heat source can be enclosed with an insulatingmaterial . The 3D printer can be configured as an oven wherethe material can cure as it is being printed . In some embodiments , the chamber containing the material to be extruded isnot in the heated or insulated region . For example , only anozzle attached to the chamber is substantially in the heatedor insulated region . For example , a heat insulating flexibleshroud can be used that moves up with the nozzle asdepicted for 3D printer 800 in FIG . 8 . The nozzle 810 , isattached to the chamber 820 and a support 830 . Flexiblewalls 840 hang down from 830 and are optionally attachedto the edges of the stage 880 . Therefore , the flexible walls ,support and stage enclose a space containing the part . Theflexible walls are designed so that they can be stretched andextended as the part 860 is printed and as the nozzle ,chamber and rigid top move up relative to the stage asindicted by the arrows . An energy source , for example , 870 ,can be attached to 830 and irradiate the sample . The energysource can be annularly arranged about the nozzle . In theembodiment shown with reference to FIG . 8 , the stagemoves in the X and Y direction while the chamber moves inthe Z direction .[ 0116 ] In some embodiments , a thermally insulating material can be extruded using a second extruder and depositedaround the part that is being printed . For example , aninsulating foam . The insulating material can be in contactwith the part or offset and surrounding the part .[ 0117 In some embodiments it is preferable to be able tomaintain the part that is being printed at an elevated temperature for the duration of the print . For example , for curinga heat curing silicone and / or epoxide . For example , thetemperature can be selected to aid in curing the particularmaterial such as maintaining the part at a temperature at leastabout 35 degrees Celsius ( e . g . , at least about 40 degreesCelsius , at least about 50 degree Celsius , at least about 60degree Celsius , at least about 70 degree Celsius , at leastabout 80 degree Celsius , at least about 90 degree Celsius , atleast about 100 degree Celsius , at least about 110 degreeCelsius , at least about 120 degree Celsius ) .[ 0118 ] It can be advantageous to further cure a printedmaterial after the printing is completed and the extrudedmaterial ( e . g . , 370 ) is partially cured . In some embodiments ,US 2017 / 0251713 A1 Sep . 7 , 201714e . g . , for throughput enhancement , it is preferable to removethe material from the printer and cure the material in a curingenvironment , for example an oven or an irradiation chamber .Since removing the printed part prior to it being fully curedcan damage / distort the part , it can be preferable for the 3Dprinter to include a stage that is at least partially removable .The part can therefore be removed with the stage and a newstage can be set in the 3D printer so that it can be utilized toprint another part while the first part is cured . For example ,the stage can be configured as a baking or cookie sheet .[ 0119 ] The 3D printer can further include one or moreadditional extruders for printing a support material . Forexample , the one or more additional extruders may bethermoplastic extruders or paste extruders . For example thesupport material can be a material that can be printed toprovide support to an overhang in the part and then be easilyremoved once the part is printed and / or has been cured . Insome embodiments the support material is a thermoplasticthat can be melted and removed from a thermally stable part( e . g . , a part that does not melt under conditions where thesupport melts , or where the melting point of the part ishigher than the melting point of the support ) . Optionally thesupport can be dissolved using a suitable solvent . Forexample , ABS plastic is dissolvable using acetone . In otherembodiments the support material can be an uncuredceramic material such as a mineral clay . The clay is preferably not heated to a high enough temperature to have it fullycure . The clay can be dried , for example due to heating , afterwhich it can be removed by shattering or brushing andwashing off . Polymer clay material can also be used . Polymer clays may cure at a low temperature in which case , ifthey cure , they can be removed by shattering away from thepart . In other embodiments the support material can be astarch or cellulose based material such as rice flower , wheatflower , cellulose powder ( e . g . , or combinations of these )optionally combined with a viscosity modifier such asxantham gum and a liquid such as water and / or an alcohols( e . g . , ethanol ) .[ 0120 ] The support material can be a brittle materialrelative to the part material when the support material isremoved from the part . For example , the support materialcan be a material that has a toughness below about 0 . 1 KJ / m²( e . g . , less than about 0 . 05 KJ / m² , or even less than about0 . 01 KJ / m ? ) while the part has a toughness greater thanabout 0 . 1 KJ / m ( e . g . , greater than about 0 . 5 KJ / m - or evengreater than about 1 KJ / m ? ) .[ 0121 ] In some embodiments the part material is moreresilient than the support material . For example the partmaterial is at least 10 times more resilient than the supportmaterial . Preferably the part material is at least 100 timesmore resilient than the support material or even more than1000 times more resilient . Ceramics such as cured clay canhave a Young ' s modulus of between about 10 and 50 GPaand a yield stress between about 50 and 140 MPa . Siliconeelastomers have a Young ' s modulus between about 0 . 0050 . 02 GPa and yield stress between about 2 . 4 G and a yieldstress of between about 18 . 5 and 51 MPa . Using the formula :Resilience = 2x ( yield stress ) / ( Young ' s Modulus ) ; bricks havea resilience between about 10 - 12 and 10 - 10 Pa , siliconeelastomers have a resilience between about 10 - and 10 - Paand ABS thermoplastics have resilience between about10 - 12 and 10 - 10 Pa .0122 ] In some embodiments the support material can bestiff relative to the cured or partially cured material . Forexample the support material can have a Young ' s Modulusabove about 0 . 1 GPa ( e . g . , above about 0 . 5 GPa or aboveabout 1 GPa ) while the cured or partially cured part can havea Young ' s modulus that is below about 0 . 1 GPa ( e . g . , belowabout 0 . 1 GPa ) . In some preferred embodiment the part ,when cured or partially cured has a Young ' s modulus that isbetween about 0 . 001 and about 0 . 1 GPa ( e . g . , between about0 . 001 and about 0 . 01 GPa ) ; and the support has a modulusbetween about 0 . 1 and about 100 ( e . g . between about 0 . 5 andabout 50 ) .[ 0123 ] The extruder for extruding support material caninclude an energy source , for example , which may be thesame or different from the primary extruder . For examplespecifically chosen for curing the support material . Forexample , if the support material is a polymer clay materialthat is cured by heating , the energy source can be a heater setto heat at about the curing temperature of the polymer clay .[ 0124 ] In some preferred embodiments the 3D printer canprint using materials with very high viscosity . For example ,materials with uncured viscosities greater than about 1million centipoise , greater than 2 million centipoise or evengreater than 10 million centipoise . For example , the 3Dprinters can print using two part silicones , one part caulkingcompounds and even materials with viscosities similar towindow putty . For example , high temperature silicones suchas MachBlocTM ( Cortape Nebr . , Inc . ) can be printed .0125 ] FIG . 9 is a diagrammatic front cross cut view of a3D printer 900 including a tube for conveying material to the3D printer stage . The printer includes many of the featurespreviously describe such as chamber 310 , material 320 ,movable wall 330 , device 340 , CNC control 350 , opening360 , extruded material 370 , and stage 380 . The opening tothe chamber 360 is attached to a tube 910 at its proximal endwhile the distal end of the tube 920 is disposed close to thestage 380 . Preferably , the tube has some flexibility so thatthe end of the tube 920 can move while the chamber remainsstationary . The end of the tube is supported by conventionalstructures , for example by being fastened to a carriage of agantry system . In some embodiments the tube moves in oneor more directions of X , Y and Z ( e . g . , X , Y , Z , X and Y ; Xand Z , or Y and Z ) while the chamber is stationary . The endof tube 920 coordinates X1 , 71 , Zi relative to position of stage380 x , y , and z , are controlled by the CNC controller .Material is extruded from the chamber through the chamberopening , through the tube and out of the distal end . Thechamber can be the screw extruder type described in FIG . 7or a progressive cavity pump . More than one chamber canbe utilized as well as mixers ( e . g . , in line mixers ) . Multiplechambers with tubes 910 ( e . g . , two or more ) can also beused , for example with a mixing chamber attached to thedistal end of tubes 910 . Energy sources , such as heater 870attached to the carriage 390 can also be used , for example ,to cure the extruded material .[ 0126 ] Other embodiments include attachment of a nonflexible tube to the chamber opening , the distal end of thetube being disposed above a stage for receiving extrudedmaterial . In this embodiment the chamber and distal end ofthe tube do not move relative to each other while printing apart , rather the stage moves .0127 The tube in the above embodiments can be temperature controlled . For example , the tube can be cooledwith a cooling loop or jacket . The tube can also include arupture disk or pressure release valve . In embodimentswherein two or more chambers are used , a mixer can beUS 2017 / 0251713 A1 Sep . 7 , 201715used . For example a tube connected to each chamber can beconnected to an in line mixer . Alternatively the chamberscan be connected directly to a mixer and a long tube thenconnected to the outlet of the mixer at the proximal end ofthe tube and the distal end disposed close the stage of the 3Dprinter .[ 0128 ] Material construction for the chambers ( e . g . , theextruders ) reflects the desired property of the printing material . For example , thick walls and / or metal construction arecontemplated in applications for extruding medium and highviscosity materials . For example , chamber walls and tubescan be made out of stainless steel or alloys such as HastelloyTM ( Haynes International , Inc . ) . In some preferredembodiments , the chamber and tubes for flowing material athigh pressure are rated to withstand an internal pressure ofat least 2000 psig ( e . g . , at least 3000 psig , at least 4000 psig ,at least 5000 psig , at least 6000 psig , at least 7000 psig , atleast 8000 psig , at least 9000 psig ) . For example , thechamber , when sealed ( e . g . , the opening is sealed ) and themovable wall is compressed , can withstand the above mentioned pressures .[ 0129 ] A rupture disk can be integrated at any pointdesigned to withstand high pressures for safety to operatorsand the equipment . For example , a chamber for containinga liquid or paste material or any part of the apparatus that isin fluid communication with the chamber and potentiallyunder high pressure . Optionally or additionally , a pressurerelease valve can be utilized . The pressure release valve canbe used for safety and / or it can also be used to avoidunwanted extrusion of material due to pressure buildup inthe chamber .[ 0130 ] In another embodiment , a release valve is used toallow removing of gases from the chamber . FIG . 10A showsan embodiment with two valves 1010 and 1030 . The valve1030 can be opened while leaving valve 1010 closed .Movement of the chamber wall 330 towards the material320 forces any gas trapped between the material 320 andwall 330 out of the opening 1040 . Subsequently , the valve1010 can be opened and valve 1030 can be closed . Movement of the chamber wall downwards ( e . g . , compressingmaterial 320 ) forces the material through opening 360 .Other configurations include having the wall slanted orcurved . For example as shown in FIG . 10B , the wall 330 isnot perpendicular to the movement of screw 342 as depictedby the double headed arrow . The valves 1010 and 1030 canbe controlled by a device such as CNC controlling device350 ( shown in previous figures ) . The valves can also act aspressure release valves e . g . , opening when a critical pressureis detected in the chamber by a pressure detector or openingat a particular time of the print to avoid oozing onto thestage .[ 0131 ] In the operation of the 3D printers fully curing ofthe feed material in the extruder ( e . g . , the chamber , tubesconnected to the chamber , mixers and nozzle ) is preferablyavoided . Some parts of the 3D printer are preferably easy tomaintain by making them easy to remove , clean and / orreplace . For example , in some embodiments a nozzle forextruding material and mixing chambers are disposable . Forexample , disposable static mixers are available from Stamixco ( Switzerland ) such as helical disposable static mixers .The nozzles can be configured as easily attachable flat nosedneedle tips , such as luer lock attachable needles or configured similar to Eppendorf pipette tips . The interior of thechamber can also include a liner that can be removed . Forexample , the feed material can be provided as a replaceablecartridge that is inserted into the chamber , once the materialis extruded out of the cartridge , the cartridge is removed anddiscarded or recycled / recharge . A cartridge for silicone can ,for example , be made of plastic and / or cardboard and fit intothe chamber . Alternatively , the equipment ( e . g . , the chamber , tubes and nozzles that contact feedstock ) can be madeto be easy to clean , for example , made of a material that canwithstand a cleaning environment such as organic solvents ,flame , high temperatures , sonication , concentrated acidsand / or concentrated bases .[ 0132 ] In some preferred embodiments the chamber canbe sealed when it is not in use for extruding material . Forexample , the outlet can be coupled to a valve ( e . g . , a needlevalve , one way valve ) or stopcock that can stop any flow ofmaterial into the chamber ( e . g . , air and / or moisture ) . Inletscan also be sealed to isolate the material in the chamber . Insome embodiments the chamber can also be easily removedfrom the 3D printer for storage purposes , cleaning or disposal ; and so that a different chamber , for example containing a different or newer feedstock , can replace the removedchamber . Any tube attached and in fluid communicationwith the chamber can also be isolated similarly ( e . g . , withvalves and / or stopcocks ) .[ 0133 ] In addition to the above embodiments , the equipment , methods and systems described above , and illustratedin FIG . 1 - 10 can be used for making metal , ceramic andcermet parts . FIG . 11 - 13 illustrate embodiments for makingmetal , ceramic and cermet parts .[ 0134 ] FIG . 11 is a flow diagram for a method to make ametal , ceramic or cermet part . The method includes mixingmetal powder and binders in step 1110 . The metal powder /binder mixture are then printed 1120 to produce part comprising metal powder and binder , which is referred to as a“ green ” part . The green part includes the metal powder andbinder mixtures but will have the form of a desired part . Thegreen part is held together mostly due to the fusion of thebinder mixture within the part . A debinding step 1130removes at least a portion of the binder leaving a partcomprising metal and which is substantially depleted inbinder , which is referred to as a “ brown ” part . The debindingstep need not remove all the binder put produces a moreporous structure through which gases can escapes duringany further heating . The brown part is then sintered 1140 .The method is applicable to making ceramic parts forexample by replacing the metal particles in step 1110 withceramic particles such as metal oxides , metal nitrides andmetal carbides . The method is also applicable to makingcermet parts for example by combining metal and ceramicparticles in step 1110 .[ 0135 ] During the mixing step 1110 metal powder ( e . g . ,and / or ceramic particles ) , binders and optionally other additives can be mixed at elevated temperatures ( e . g . , 120 - 200°C . ) . Without being bound by any specific theory , it isbelieved that heating melts the binders and optional additives so that they are in a liquid state and can coat the metalpowders .[ 0136 ] Metal powders can be made from any metal andinclude metal alloys . For example , metal powders that areused in metal injection molding and powder metallurgyincluding micro - powder injection molding can be used . Forexample metals selected from the group consisting of iron ,nickel , chromium , zinc , cobalt , titanium , cadmium , molybdenum , tungsten , copper , gold , lead , aluminum , magnesium ,US 2017 / 0251713 A1 Sep . 7 , 201716manganese , silver , tin , platinum , palladium , iridium , rhodium , ruthenium alloys of these and mixtures of these . Metalpowders can also be substituted by ceramic powders such asmetal oxides ( e . g . , alumina , silicon oxide ) , nitrides ( e . g . ,silicon nitride , tungsten nitride , titanium nitride ) , carbides( e . g . , silicon carbide , tungsten carbide ) and combinations ofthese ( e . g . , titanium carbonitride ) can be used . Mixtures ofmetal powders and ceramic powders can also be used , e . g . ,to make Cermet objects . Metal and ceramic powder sizescan be selected so that they are at least 10 times smaller thanthe minimum feature size of the final sintered part . Theparticle size also should be at least smaller than any openingthe particle flows through such as an extruder nozzle ( e . g . ,at least half the size , at least 1 / 5th the size , at least 10 timessmaller ) . For example , average particle sizes can rangewidely for example being between about 0 . 1 and about 100microns although preferred particles sizes are between about1 and about 50 microns . Spherical , lozenge shaped , fibrous ,dendritic and irregular shaped particles can be utilized .Spherical shaped particles show preferable flow propertieswhile more irregular shaped particles can form strongergreen part and / or brown part .[ 0137 ] Binders can be selected from thermoplastics suchas mixtures of one or more low molecular weight polymers ,waxes or oils ( e . g . , paraffin wax , palm oil or polyethyleneglycol ) and one or more high molecular weight polymers( e . g . , high density polyethylene , linear low density polyethylene , polypropylene or poly ( ethylene vinyl acetate ) ) . Inaddition water soluble binders ( e . g . , polyethylene oxide ) ,acid degradable binders and base degradable binders can beutilized . Other binders can include natural polymers such asstarch ( e . g . , tapioca starch ) , poly ( ethylene - co - acrylic acid ) ,ethylene - diene - propylene ( EPDM ) , polybutenes , polystyrene , poly ( methyl methacrylate ) , poly ( vinyl butyral ) , polyacetal , methyle cellulose and polyamides .[ 0138 ] Additives can be surface active agents such as longchain alcohols , carboxylic acids , amines , sulfonates andphosphonates . Other surface active agents include blockco - polymers such as ethylene oxide - polyethylene oxidecopolymers . For example stearic acid , steryl alcohol , oleicacid and oleyl alcohol can be used as additives and canimprove compatibility between the metal powder andbinder .[ 0139 ] Mixing of the powders and binders can provide ahomogenous combination of the powder and binder andensure the metal and / or ceramic particles do not separatefrom the binder upon re - heating and melting such as duringextrusion through a heated nozzle . Preferably , the powderand binder combination have a melting point below about200° C . and have a melt viscosity below about 10 pascalseconds ( Pa - s ) . In some embodiments the metal powder /binder mixture is pelletized .[ 0140 ] During the printing step 1120 the mixture producedin step 1110 can be used in a printer as described above .Some additional embodiments of printers and methods aredescribed below .[ 0141 ] During the debinding step 1130 at least a portion ofthe binder and additives are removed from the green moldedpart . For example , this can be done by heating the green part ,chemically degrading the organic binders / additives or subjecting the part to solvent extraction . Heating to moderatetemperatures ( e . g . , below 400° C . ) can melt or , in anoxidizing atmosphere , burn off the binders . Solvent extrac -tion removes the binders / additives through dissolution of theorganic binders and additives . The solvent utilized duringthe extraction depends on the binders and additives and caninclude water ( e . g . , neutral , acidic or basic ) or organicsolvents ( e . g . , alcohols , acids , ketones , aldehydes , esters ,hydrocarbons , aromatics , mixtures of these ) . Debindingsolvents can also include supercritical solvents such assupercritical CO2 . Debinding produces what is known as a“ brown ” part which is a weak brittle part with a large ( e . g . ,greater than about 10 % ) void volume . As noted , debindingneed not remove all the binders and additives since residualorganics can be removed during the initial stages of the nextstep , the sintering stage .[ 0142 ] Sintering 1140 can include heating to high temperatures ( e . g . , at least about 400° C . , at least about 600° C . ,preferably at least about 700° C . , such as at least 1000° C . ) .Sintering is preferably done in an oxygen - free or reducingatmosphere and / or in the presence of a reducing agent . Forexample , the oxygen - free atmosphere can be argon , nitrogen , helium or mixtures of two or more of these with lessthan about 1 vol % oxygen . A reducing atmosphere caninclude having hydrogen present in the atmosphere . Areducing agent can be used such as carbon , for exampleactivated carbon upon which the brown part is placed .Sintering can produce a part with a density of at least about97 % ( e . g . , having less than about 3 % void volume ) .[ 0143 ] FIG . 12A - 12D is a pictorial flow diagram showingcross cut views of chambers for extruding materials and howto remove air therein before extrusion . The feedstock 320can be a metal / binder , ceramic / binder or cermet ( e . g . , metaland ceramic / binder combination as previously described( e . g . , metal and thermoplastic powders mixed together ) .FIG . 12A shows the feedstock loaded into the chamber 310( e . g . , a syringe extruder ) . The valves 1030 and 1010 areclosed and the chamber is heated so that it melts as shownin FIG . 12B . As the material 320 melts , any trapped airbubbles , 1210 , move upwards towards the top of the chamber and collect in the headspace between the movablechamber wall 330 and the molten feedstock 320 . Optionally ,vibration can be applied to the chamber such as by using avibratory transducer or a sonicator e . g . , to aid in havinggases migrate to the headspace . In a subsequent step shownby FIG . 12C , valve 1030 is opened to allow the headspacegas to be pushed out of the chamber . For example , movablewall 330 is moved towards the molten material 320 forcinggas 1210 out of opening 1020 as indicated by the arrow . Asshown in FIG . 12D , once the gas has been removed , valve1030 is closed , valve 1010 is opened , and material canextrude through opening 60 as depicted by the arrow . Greenparts are then made as previously described . This methodand apparatus can be used for loading and degassing anymaterial comprising a thermoplastic such as plastics andfoods that can be melted ( e . g . , chocolate , caramel , fats , icingand fondants ) . Likewise liquids can be degassed using thismethod and apparatus except that heating may not berequired or desired ( e . g . , heating would not be desired if thematerial is a heat curing material ) .[ 0144 ] In another optional embodiment for making metal ,ceramic or cermet parts the powder / binder precursor isinitially formed into a part that can fit into the chamber ( e . g . ,the chamber 310 ) . For example , the initially formed part ismade to be commensurate in size to the internal volume ofthe chamber . FIG . 13 shows an embodiment for producingan initially formed part in the shape commensurate with achamber 1310 in the form of a syringe . A powder / binderUS 2017 / 0251713 A1 Sep . 7 , 201717precursor 1310 ( e . g . , that has been mixed as previouslydescribed ) is formed into a cylinder 1320 . The cylinder canbe formed by injection molding or melting it into a cylindershaped mold . The cylinder is then loaded into chamber 1310equipped with a heater 1340 disposed to heat at least the tipof the chamber proximate to the chamber opening 360 .Compression of the syringe barrel 1360 forces the partformed as a cylinder down and into the heated zone wherethe part can melt and be extruded out of the syringe to makea part 1370 . The part 1370 can then be subjected to debinding and sintering as previously described . This method andapparatus can be used for loading any material comprisinga thermoplastic such as plastics and foods that can be melted( e . g . , chocolate , caramel , fats , icing and fondants ) andsolidified / molded into a rigid shape .heated bed at print temperature for 2 hours . After this timeadditional layers of the part were printed up to 15 cm . Theepoxy was added on top of the cured epoxy to fill the holeand this was allowed to cure for 15 min . The final 5 cm ofthe part were printed and epoxy was filled in the hole . Thepart was then taken off the build platform and allowed tocure for an additional 30 min . This produced ABS / epoxycomposite part 1500 shown in FIG . 15 , with ABS portion1510 and epoxy portion 1520 . A raft portion 1530 , madewith ABS , can be removed from the part . The part isconsidered fully cured after about 24 hours . Fully curingbetween fillings with epoxy is not required since the ABSpart contained the epoxy precursor .EXEMPLIFICATIONExample 2[ 0154 ] FIG . 16 shows a part that can be made by themethods described herein . The part consists of negativestiffness honey comb 1610 that has one row 1620 filled withpolydicylcopentadiene ( P - DCPD ) . The honeycomb is madeby 3D printing of ABS under conditions similar to those inexample 1 . The p - DCPD is made by mixing dicyclopentadiene ( DCPD ) at > 40 degree Celsius and ROMP catalyst( ( 1 , 3 - Bis ( 2 , 4 , 6 - trimethylphenyl ) - 2 - imidazolidinylidene ) dichloro ( phenylmethylene ) ( tricyclohexylphosphine ) ruthenium , Aldrich Cat no 569747 ) , in a ratio of 6 . 8 mg catalystto 50 mL DCPD . Iterations of printing honeycomb andfilling with DCPD + catalyst can produce the part .Example 1[ 0145 ] Computer Aided Design was used to design themodel shown in FIG . 14A as an isometric projection and14B as a front cross cut view . The model is for a part havinga diameter of 5 cm and a height of 2 cm . The model alsofeatured a hole in the center with a diameter of 2 cm anddepth of 1 . 5 cm . Slicing program Simplfy3D was then usedto produce G - code that could be used to print a part basedon the model using a Flashforge 3D printer ( Flashforge ,USA ) and red ABS filament10146 ] . The conditions for printing were :10147 ] Extruder : Nozzle diameter 0 . 4 mm ; Retractiondistance 1 . 00 mm ; Retraction speed 1200 mm / min ;0148 ] Layers : Primary layer height 0 . 2 mm ; Top solidlayers 3 ; Bottom solid layers 3 ; Outline / perimeter shells 2 ;Outline Direction inside out ; First layer height 90 % ; Firstlayer width 100 % ; First layer speed 50 % ; Start point optimize start points for fastest printing speed[ 0149 ] Additions : Use skirt / Brim ; Skirt layers 1 ; Startoffset from part 4 mm ; Skirt outlines 2 ; Use raft layers ; Raftlayers 3 ; Raft outline from part 4 mm ; Separation distance0 . 1 mm ; Raft infill 85 % ;[ 0150 ] Infill : Internal fill pattern rectilinear ; External fillpattern rectilinear ; Interior fill percentage 20 % ; Outlineoverlap 20 % ; Infill extrusion width 100 % ; Minimum infilllength 5 mm ; Print sparse infill every 1 layers ; Infill angleoffsets 0 degree ; angle 45 and - 45 degree ;[ 0151 ] Support : none ;[ 0152 ] Temperatures for print : Extruder 230 degree Celsius ; Heated build platform 110 degree Celsius .[ 0153 ] The procedure to create the part was as follows .The designed part was printed oriented as shown by themodel in FIG . 13A with X and Y oriented along the builtplatform and layer by layer upwards in the Z direction .Printing was done until 10 mm upwards was reached and theprint was paused . The partial part with the hole ( container )in the center was filled with a 2 part epoxy ( Devcon® home ;ITW , Solon , Ohio ) that had been thoroughly mixed just priorto it being used . The container can be filled using a staticinline mixer to mix the two parts and a syringe pump to drivethe plunger and mixed material into the hole . The nozzle tipcan be placed above the hole while filling , for example fixedto the carriage of the Flashforge print head . No movement ofthe nozzle tip is needed since the 2 part epoxy flows into thecontainer and levels easily . The partial part with epoxy wasallowed to cure while maintaining the temperature of theExample 3[ 0155 ] A 3D printer was constructed using a 30x50 CNCmill having Nema 23 motors coupled to direct drive screwlinear actuators for X , Y , and Z movement of the printinghead above a stationary stage . The printing head consisted ofa Nema 17 direct screw drive linear actuator designed forholding syringes . CNC control was provided by a RUMBAMotherboard which features an ATmega2560 with 3Dprinter outputs such as Pololu pin compatible stepper drives ,heated bead and heated extruder outputs . The board wasflashed with Marlin software adapted for the syringeextruder .[ 0156 ] Various shapes , shown in FIG . 17 were designedand are shown in iso and top view . The shapes are of afootball 1710 , a heart 1720 and a wrench 1730 . All coverabout an area of about 25 cm² and had walls 1712 , 1722 , and1732 0 . 5 cm thick and 2 cm tall . The shapes had no bottomor top .[ 0157 ] A paste was made by mixing rice flour , xanthanGum and water in a 11 : 1 : 8 ratio by volume using a foodblender . The paste was loaded into a 60 mL syringe andmounted into the print head of the 3D printer . The shapesshown in FIG . 17 were printed using the 3D printer onto abaking sheet . The printed object provided a container withthe baking sheet as a bottom walls 1714 , 1724 and 1734 , andthe rice paste as the side walls . Each object was filled witha chocolate batter up to about 1 cm and then baked . Thebaked object retained the shape of the printed rice paste . Therice paste was removed providing a baked item in the shapeof a football , a heart and a wrench .Example 4[ 0158 ] A wrench as described in Example 3 was printed .The shape was filled with a two part epoxy and allowed toset overnight . The rice paste was removed by washing withUS 2017 / 0251713 A1 Sep . 7 , 2017water providing a wrench made of epoxy . Addition ofamylase enzyme and gentle heating ( e . g . , at about 40 - 70degrees Celsius ) in the water can facilitate the removal of thestarchy paste .Example 5[ 0159 ] Masks made out of high temperature silicones anduseful for protecting parts during shot peening can beproduced using 3D printing methods . A mask 1810 for part1820 are shown in FIG . 18A . The mask can be producedusing a syringe extruder to print the part from a hightemperature curable silicone MachblocTM ( Tapeworks , Inc ) .The viscosity of this material is expect to be more than about100 million cP at 20 degrees Celsius . The mask was curedat 125 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 min in an oven . Curing canbe also done while printing the part . A support material suchas ABS in the shape of the part can be used and thenremoved . FIG . 18B depicts the shot peening process with themask protecting the portion of the part that should not beabraded . In practice , the mask would be in contact with thepart and is shown in this blown up version for more clarity .The arrows show the movement of particles during the shotpeening process .[ 0160 ] Other than in the examples herein , or unless otherwise expressly specified , all of the numerical ranges ,amounts , values and percentages , such as those for amountsof materials , elemental contents , times and temperatures ofreaction , ratios of amounts , and others , in the followingportion of the specification and attached claims may be readas if prefaced by the word “ about ” even though the term" about ” may not expressly appear with the value , amount , orrange .
