ABSTRACT: In this research, a multilayered superhydrophobic coating for urinary catheters was synthesized by a
layer-by-layer deposition technique. A mussel-inspired polydopamine coating was utilized as a platform for the in situ
anchoring of silver nanoparticles followed by hydrophobic
modification with 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecanethiol. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of hierarchical micro/
nanostructures and antibacterial silver nanoparticles, the
prepared catheters exhibited excellent superhydrophobicity
and prolonged antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli
WT F1693 and Proteus mirabilis WT F1697. Compared with
commercial all-silicone and silver-alloy-hydrogel catheters, the
superhydrophobic catheter exhibited significant antibiofilm
activities in both static and dynamic models. In an in vitro bladder model, bacterial migration along the outer catheter was
effectively delayed, reducing biomass accumulation by up to 55 and 90% compared with all-silicone and silver-alloy-hydrogel
catheters. Encrustations in the catheter lumen were also retarded, extending the lifetime of silicone catheters from ∼40 to ∼100
h. The superhydrophobic catheter also exhibited good biocompatibility to the L929 mouse fibroblasts, therefore providing a
promising direction for the future design of urinary catheters.

INTRODUCTION
The high incidence of infections and encrustation caused by
the use of urinary catheters has a severe impact on human
health and health care costs.1,2 The root cause lies in the early
onset of contamination where bacteria migrate along the
exterior or the internal lumen of the catheter into the bladder
leading to complications such as bacteriuria, prostatitis,
septicaemia, and shock.3,4 Moreover, bacterial adhesion
initiates a cascade of events and results in the formation of a
biofilm, which has been found to be responsible for the
persistence of infections in patients who undergo long-term
catheterization.3,5 Numerous attempts have been made to
prevent/retard catheter-associated urinary tract infection
(CAUTI) and encrustation by coating catheters with antibiotics, silver, hydrogels, or polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE).6−8 However, clinical studies indicate that such coated
catheters provide an insignificant reduction in CAUTI or
encrustation formation.9,10
Superhydrophobic coatings are well-known for their selfcleaning properties, which work through extreme water
repellence to form near spherical water droplets that remove
contaminants.11 When in contact with water, a thin layer of air
can be trapped within the micro/nanostructures on the
superhydrophobic surface, which inhibits bacterial colonization.12 Recent studies also showed that catheters with
superhydrophobic textiles significantly facilitated liquid flow
through a closed-system catheter tube when compared with a
standard closed-tube system.13 These results indicate that a
urinary catheter with a superhydrophobic surface may allow
urine flow to efficiently wash off adhered bacteria and provide
minimal colonization sites for new bacteria, thereby delaying
biofilm formation and subsequent complications. However,
few studies have been carried out on superhydrophobic urinary
catheters for antibacterial applications.
In this study, we report the preparation of a multilayered
superhydrophobic coating for urinary catheters via a musselinspired strategy. Their ability to inhibit biofilm formation was
examined in both static and dynamic models and compared
silver-alloy-hydrogel-coated (BARDEX I.C., Bard, West Sussex,
USA) and all-silicone (Rüsch, Teleflex, Buckinghamshire, UK)
catheters. To test their ability to resist bacterial migration, a
modified in vitro bladder model and a catheter bridge model
were used to mimic both humid and dry conditions. To verify
their efficacy against encrustation, the catheters were
challenged with Proteus mirabilis in a clinically relevant
continuous flow in vitro bladder model system. Their

L929 mouse fibroblast cells.
■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Preparation of Superhydrophobic Coatings. The superhydrophobic coating (SC) was prepared via continuous deposition
of polydopamine (PDA) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) followed
by hydrophobic modification with 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecanethiol (PFDT) (Scheme 1). The precut 3 cm long all-silicone Foley
catheters (with a diameter of 5.0 mm) were thoroughly rinsed in
absolute ethanol and deionized water (DI). Afterward, the catheters
were prewetted by ethanol and then immersed in an aqueous solution
of dopamine (2 mg/mL in 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.5) for 24 h to
allow the spontaneous deposition of a thin adherent polymer film.
Afterward, the catheters were thoroughly washed with DI and
immersed in 0.01 M AgNO3 solution for 10 h without exposure to
light at room temperature (RT). Finally, the catheter surfaces were
modified in a sealed anaerobic ethanol solution containing
1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecanethiol (500:1, v/v) for 12 h at room
temperature and dried at 100 °C for 1 h (Scheme 1). The prepared
catheters were then cut into 2 and 1 cm segments for the biofilm
adhesion assay and bacterial migration assay, respectively.
Surface Characterization. The surface morphology of the
coatings was characterized using a field emission-scanning electron
microscope (FE-SEM, JEOL JSM-7400F, Tokyo, Japan) and an
atomic force microscope (AFM, Dimension 3000, Santa Barbara, CA,
U.S.A.). ImageJ (LOCI, University of Wisconsin, Wisconsin, USA)
was used to identify the PDA and silver particles, and their size
distributions were calculated from random SEM images. The surface
compositions were characterized by UHV X-ray photoemission (XPS,
ESCALAB 250, Waltham, U.S.A.). The surface wettability was
characterized by measuring the contact angle using a Dataphysics
OCA-20 contact angle analyzer (DataPhysics Instruments GmbH,
Filderstadt, Germany).
Ag+ Release and Biofilm Adhesion. The release profiles of Ag+
from the catheters were characterized by immersing 1 cm long
catheter segments (n = 3) in 5 mL of artificial urine (AU). Every day
for 7 days, the AU was collected, assayed for Ag+ concentrations using
atomic absorption spectrometry (PerkinElmer, AAnalyst 400, U.S.A.),
and replaced with fresh AU. Silver release was expressed in μm/cm2
.
The silver loading of the SC catheter was also determined by
immersing 1 cm long catheter segments in 20 mL of 0.1 M nitric acid
(HNO3) until the silver was fully dissolved. The silver concentration
was determined by AAS.
The antibiofilm assay was performed according to a previously
reported method.14 In brief, the 2 cm long catheters including the SC
catheters, silver-alloy-hydrogel (AgH)-coated Foley catheters (with a
diameter of 5.0 mm), and all-silicone Foley catheters were incubated
with 5 mL of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis (∼2 × 108 CFU/
mL) in tryptic soy broth (TSB) at 30 rpm at 37 °C for 48 h,
respectively. The biofilm on the catheter surface was observed using
SEM. The number of adhering bacteria was determined using the
viable plate counting method. To further mimic real conditions, the
antibiofilm ability of the catheters was tested with a dynamic flow
model at 37 °C for 7 days (Scheme 2).15 The model allowed urine to
continuously flow through the catheters and provided a favorable
environment for biofilm formation. Artificial urine16 (without urea)
containing ∼2 × 108 CFU/mL of bacteria was pumped through the
catheter lumen via a peristaltic pump at a steady rate of 0.5 mL/min.
The AU was refreshed every 24 h. After 7 days, the catheters were
collected and plated for colony counting. To determine the viability of
the adhered bacteria, the cells were stained using a LIVE/DEAD
Baclight bacterial viability kit L13152 (Fisher Scientific, UK) and
observed under a fluorescence microscope (OLYMPUS BX 41,
Japan).
Bacterial Migration Assays. As for the bladder model,17 a simple
modification was applied. As shown in Figure 5a, the catheter
segments (n = 4, 3.5 cm long) were perpendicularly immersed in the
bacterial suspension (∼2 × 108 CFU/mL, 5% dextrose solution). The
end of the catheter (0.5 cm long) immersed in the bacterial
suspension was regarded as the site of infection. After 7 days’
coincubation, the catheters were removed from the suspension, and
the biofilm formed on the catheters was observed by SEM. Moreover,
the biomass formed along the catheters was quantified by crystal
violet staining.18 The catheter bridge model was constructed from
tryptone soya agar (TSA) plates with two 0.85 cm wide perpendicular
channels. Aliquots (10 μL) of the bacterial cultures (∼2 × 108 CFU/
mL) were inoculated at the edge of the central channel of each plate
and dried before the catheter segments (1.0 cm long) were placed
across the channels. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, the growth of
test strains on the uninoculated halves of the plates was examined. A
fourth inoculum was not provided with a bridge to confirm that the
bacterial migration was through the catheter and not the Petri dish
surface.

Encrustation Assay. The efficacy of the SC catheter against
encrustation was assayed with P. mirabilis in an in vitro bladder
model.19 After sterilization via autoclaving, the catheters (n = 3) were
fixed through a funnel and inserted aseptically into the “bladder”,
which was prefilled with P. mirabilis culture (∼2 × 107 CFU/mL) in
AU (Figure 10a). After 1 h, sterile artificial urine was pumped into the
“bladder” via a peristaltic pump at a physiological flow rate of 0.5 mL/
min to ensure the urine level was above the drainage holes. The
blockage time was recorded, and the encrustations in the catheter
lumen were observed by SEM.
Cytotoxicity Assay. The cytotoxicity of the superhydrophobic
catheters was tested using an MTT method according to our
previously reported study.20 Mouse fibroblast cells L929 were seeded
at ∼105 cells/well into 24 well plates and incubated with the catheters
(n = 4) for up to 72 h. The relative cell viability was determined by
measuring the absorbance at 570 nm and comparing this with the
control (silicone catheter). The cell morphology was also examined
after 72 h of culture using confocal microscopy (Leica SP8 confocal
microscope, Wetzlar, Germany).
Statistical Analysis. One-way ANOVA was used for all statistical
analyses, and data were represented as the means ± standard
deviation. p < 0.05 was considered significant, and p < 0.01 was
considered highly significant.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Surface Characterization. As seen in Figure 1a,k, the
uncoated silicone surface exhibited a smooth morphology with
a surface roughness of 61.2 ± 1.9 nm. After PDA deposition,
the catheter surface exhibited a hierarchical micro/nano
roughness (Figure 1a,b). PDA nanoparticles with a wide
particle size distribution (ranging from ∼50 to ∼800 nm)
aggregated onto the silicone substrate and constructed a
micro/nano hierarchical structure with a roughness of 139.1 ±
8.4 nm, leading to a significant wettability conversion from
hydrophobic to hydrophilic (Figure 1b,e,h,l). To enhance the
hierarchical structures, silver nanoparticles with an average
diameter of 100−150 nm were homogeneously deposited and
grown in situ on the PDA surface (Figure 1c,f), resulting in an
increase in surface roughness (225.3 ± 4.7 nm) and a further
decrease in the water contact angle (WCA) from 40.1 ± 0.9 to
28.7 ± 1.4° (Figure 1i,m). PFDT used as the hydrophobic
modifier as the mercapto group could strongly attach to silver,
and the perfluoroalkyl chains could impart a very low surface
tension to the surface.21,22 The surface roughness decreased to
194.8 ± 2.7 nm, but no significant difference in particle shape
and size was observed (Figure 1d,n). However, the surface
exhibited extremely high water repellency with a WCA of 154.7
± 1.1° (Figure 1j) and a sliding angle <5°. Figure S1 shows the
cross section view of the SC, which was very uniform with a
thickness of ∼950 nm. The chemical composition of the
obtained superhydrophobic coating was studied by X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As seen in Figure 2a, the
XPS wide scan spectrum of the coating exhibited characterized
peaks of Ag 3d, Si 2p, and F 1s. The Ag 3d XPS spectra were
deconvoluted into two asymmetric peaks with binding energies
of 368.4 eV (Ag 3d3/2) and 374.5 eV (Ag 3d5/2), which
indicated the formation of elemental silver nanoparticles
(Figure 2a). In the S 2p and F 1s narrow scans, there existed
only two strong peaks with binding energies of 162.7 and 688.0
eV, which respectively correspond to the C−S and C−F
groups in the molecular structure of the PFDT oligomer
(Figure 2c,d). These results confirm the formation of a PFDT
layer on the superhydrophobic coating. In Movie S1, the water
droplet bounces off the surface without wetting or adhering to
the surface, which further revealed its superhydrophobicity.
Movies S2 and S3 show the water drop tests (released from a
height of 1 cm) on the superhydrophobic catheter surface and
a bare silicone catheter surface, respectively. An obvious
difference was observed in the retraction processes (Figure 3).
It took ∼26 ms for the impacting water droplet to complete
the overall process on the superhydrophobic surface, while the
impacting water droplet could not bounce off the silicone
surface due to strong adhesion.23
Ag+ Release and Biofilm Formation. As seen in Figure
4a, the SC and AgH catheters showed different kinetic release
profiles although their silver loadings were relatively close (SC
catheters, 21.4 ± 1.1 μg/cm2
; AgH catheters, 17.8 ± 0.6 μg/
cm2
). The AgH catheters released significantly higher (p <
0.01) amounts of Ag+ over the initial 3 days. However, the
daily release rate decreased sharply after 4 days and became
relatively constant (∼0.13 μg/cm2
) afterward. For the SC
catheters, the Ag+ release rate from the SC catheters was
relatively constant during the test period (∼0.18 μg/cm2
).
The antibiofilm activity of the SC catheter was compared
with both hydrophilic catheters (PDA, PDA−Ag, silver-alloyhydrogel (AgH)-coated catheters) and hydrophobic all-silicone
catheters. In this study, tryptic soy broth (TSB) was used as
the culture medium, aiming at stimulating bacterial growth and
accelerating biofilm formation. Our previous study showed that
the silicone catheter was fully covered by a biofilm under such
conditions.14 As shown in Figures 4c and 5, the AgH-coated
catheters showed the highest levels of biofilm formation for
both E. coli and P. mirabilis. Although there is evidence
showing the effectiveness of AgH-coated catheters against
CAUTI occurrence, the presence of tryptone in the culture
medium may facilitate bacterial colonization and biofilm
formation through cross-linking of the hydrogel polymer
chains.24−26 In contrast, hydrophilic PDA and PDA−Agcoated surfaces appeared to exhibit improved antibiofilm
properties when compared with the bare silicone surface (p <
0.01). However, no significant difference (p > 0.05) in
antibiofilm activity was detected between the PDA and PDA−
Ag surfaces. After modification with PFDT, the SC catheters
were found to be most resistant to bacterial colonization, and
no trace of a mature biofilm was detected. The results showed
that the SC catheters reduced the adhesion of E. coli and P.
mirabilis by 96.1 and 84.9%, respectively, when compared with
the unmodified silicone catheters and reduced adhesion of E.
coli and P. mirabilis by 97.4 and 90.5%, respectively, when
compared with the AgH catheters.
Clinically, most cases of CAUTIs (over 66%) are caused by
bacteria ascending into the bladder via the extraluminal
route,27 and biofilm formation has been found to augment

bacterial migration along catheter surfaces.28−30 Previous
studies have reported that the air trapped in the micro/nano
structures could be lost over time, leading to the loss of surface
superhydrophobicity and antiadhesion properties.31−33 However, as seen in Figures 5 and S2, the integrity of the
hierarchical structures in the SC was well-preserved, and the air
film inhibited penetration of bacterial culture medium.
Moreover, water flow over the SC may exert sufficient shear
stress to cause adhering bacteria to slide and roll over the
surface.34 To mimic real conditions, antibiofilm performance
was evaluated in AU with a dynamic flow model over a period
of 7 days. As seen in Figure 4d, no significant difference in
bacterial adhesion was found among the silicone, PDA, PDA−
Ag, and AgH catheters (p > 0.05). The SC catheters still
exhibited the highest antibiofilm efficacy, reducing the
adhesion of E. coli and P. mirabilis by 67.1 and 60.2%
respectively, compared with the silicone catheters.
Although it is generally believed that the antibacterial
activity of a silver-containing coating depends on free Ag+
release, our results showed that the SC catheters were more
resistant to biofilm formation when compared with an AgH
catheter. To further understand the antibiofilm mechanism of
the SC surface, the WCA on the SC surface was also
monitored against immersion time. As shown in Figure 4b, the
WCA was relatively stable over the initial 3 days and gradually
decreased from ∼150 to ∼120°. This could be due to
penetration of the surrounding medium through the air film
under hydraulic pressure. However, the loss of superhydrophobicity did not compromise its antibiofilm activity
during the test period. Figure S3 shows the adhering live and
dead bacterial cells on silicone and SC surfaces in the dynamic
biofilm assay over 7 days. For both strains, the silicone surfaces
were nearly covered with biofilm, and most of the adhered cells
were alive (green). In comparison, the numbers of adhering
bacteria on SC surfaces were significantly lower (p < 0.01)
than those on silicone surfaces, and a large quantity of dead
cells (red) were observed. This could be related to the
antibacterial Ag+ released from the SC.
The above results indicated that the enhanced antibiofilm
efficacy could be explained using a two-stage model. In the
initial stage, due to air-trapping ability, an air film barrier was
formed on the SC surface that prevented bacterial adhesion
and also reduced the direct contact between the Ag
nanoparticles and the surrounding media, leading to a
relatively slow but continuous release of silver ions. However,
with increasing immersion time, water gradually penetrated
into the micro/nano structure due to the hydraulic pressure,
leading to an increase in the surface area exposed to bacterial
culture media. Meanwhile, the underlying silver nanoparticles
were activated by the surrounding media and released Ag+ to
kill the bacteria and retard biofilm formation.
Bacterial Migration. The migration of E. coli and P.
mirabilis along the catheter surfaces was assessed in vitro in
both humid and dry conditions considering that urine flow
over the catheter surfaces is usually intermittent and weak. As
shown in Figure 6, upon challenge with ∼108 CFU/mL of
bacteria, all the catheters were contaminated for their full
length (3 cm) after 7 days. However, there was a significant
difference in biomass accumulation between these catheters.
For both strains, the amount of biomass on the catheter
surfaces showed a “pyramid-shaped” distribution from the
“infection site” to the top (Figure 6b,c). The AgH catheter
surfaces showed the highest levels of biomass accumulation on
all sections. These results together with the above biofilm assay
indicated that AgH coatings may not be able to impede
bacterial adhesion and migration in a nutrient-rich culture
medium. Similar results have been reported in other
studies.4,35,36 In comparison, the SC effectively inhibited
bacterial migration and showed the lowest biomass accumulation giving a reduction of over 47 and 84% for E. coli (55 and

90% for P. mirabilis) biomass accumulation on the rear end of
the catheter when compared with silicone and AgH,
respectively.
It has been reported that flagellated bacteria have the ability
to swarm over various types of urinary catheters and secrete
extracellular polymer substance (EPS) that can trap motile
bacteria and induce swarm cell differentiation.4,36,37 For
silicone catheters, Figures 7 and 8 clearly showed the bacteria
migrating along the catheter surfaces. For example, E. coli
migrated along the catheter after reaching a high enough
density at the “infection site”, aligning in multicellular rafts and
enveloped in EPS. However, such migration was delayed on
the SC, although a dense biofilm was formed on the section in
the vicinity of a bacterial suspension. The hydraulic pressure

leads to penetration of the air film by the culture medium with
increased immersion time, resulting in the loss of antiadhesion
ability.
In the bridge model, the time (means of three replicates)
that E. coli took to migrate through the 1 cm sections varied
from 13.0 ± 1.7 h over silver-alloy-hydrogel catheters, 16.8 ±
2.1 h over silicone catheters, and 18.2 ± 1.2 h over the
superhydrophobic catheters. For P. mirabilis, the times were
relatively shorter: 10.0 ± 0.9 h over silver-alloy-hydrogel
catheters, 12.8 ± 3.1 h over silicone catheters, and 14.5 ± 2.4 h
over the superhydrophobic catheters. Figure 9 shows bacterial
migration over the different catheter bridges after 24 h. The
differences in the times for migration by the bacterial cells
across the bridge for unmodified silicone catheters and SC
catheters were not significant (p > 0.05). This could be
explained as follows: for the SC catheter, the results of

antibiofilm tests suggested that the primary mechanism for
resisting bacterial adhesion in the initial stage was related to
the superhydrophobicity. However, in the bridge model, the
catheters were fixed between solid agar blocks, and there was
no water flow over the catheter surfaces. Although the bridge
model does not exactly reflect real conditions, it has been
widely used as a simple laboratory model to examine the
antibacterial activity of a catheter surface against bacterial
migration.37,38 Therefore, the insignificant p-value indicated
that the SC coating did not exhibit a desirable antibacterial
effect on bacterial migration over the surface with the bladder
model.
Encrustation Assay. The efficacy of SC catheters against
encrustation was examined with P. mirabilis via an in vitro
bladder model (Figure 10a). This model has proven to be very
effective in simulating the encrustation process, and our
previous study suggested that the blockage time is independent
of the initial bacterial concentration.19 As shown in Figure 10b,
the times taken to block an uncoated silicone catheter and an
SC catheter were 41.3 ± 1.7 and 101.4 ± 6.9 h, respectively.
The catheters were also removed after 48 h to compare the
encrustation in the catheter lumen (Figure 10b,c). The silicone
catheter lumen was fully blocked with crystalline encrustation,
while only discontinuous crystals were found in the SC
catheter lumen. Previous studies reported that the all-silicone
catheter can remain in situ for up to 12 weeks; it would not be
surprising that the SC catheter could further reduce the risk of
CAUTI and provide a longer period of protection during
catheterization due to the improved antibiofilm and antiencrustation properties.14
Cytotoxicity Assay. In this study, we conducted the
cytotoxicity assay with mammalian cells to demonstrate

catheter biocompatibility. As seen in Figure 11, no significant
difference in cell viability was found between silicone, PDA,
and SC catheters during 72 h of culture (p > 0.05). However, a
significant decrease (p < 0.01) in cell viability was found in the
PDA−Ag group. This could be due to the excessive release of
Ag+ in the initial 3 days. After modification with PFDT, the
silver release was controlled, leading to improved biocompatibility. This was further verified by observing cell morphologies
by confocal microscopy (Figure 12).
CONCLUSIONS
In this study, superhydrophobic coatings with hierarchical
micro/nanostructures were prepared for urinary catheters via a
mussel-inspired approach. The superhydrophobic catheters
demonstrated superior antibiofilm properties against two
common uropathogens, E. coli and P. mirabilis, under both
static and dynamic conditions when compared with
commercial all-silicone and silver-alloy-hydrogel catheters.
The enhanced antibiofilm efficacy was derived from a
synergistic effect of superhydrophobicity and antibacterial Ag
nanoparticles. The superhydrophobic feature could prevent/
retard bacterial attachment and control silver ion release,
which endowed the surface with antibacterial activity and
improved biocompatibility. Bacterial migration along the outer
surface was effectively delayed when examined in an in vitro
bladder model. Encrustations in the catheter lumen were also
retarded, extending the blockage time from ∼40 to ∼100 h.
These positive results indicate a new potential direction for
designing urinary catheters to reduce CAUTI.
