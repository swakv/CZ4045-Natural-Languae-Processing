abstract
Undesired physiological instability of nanocarriers and premature drug leakage during blood circulation
result in compromised therapeutic efficacy and severe side effects, which have significantly impeded the
development of nanomedicine. Facile crosslinking of drug-loaded nanocarriers while keeping the potency of site-specific degradation and drug release has emerged as a viable strategy to overcome these
drawbacks. Additionally, combination therapy has already shown advantages in inhibiting advanced
tumors and life extension than single drug therapy. Herein, three kinds of diselenide-rich polymers were
fabricated with distinct hydrophobic side chains. The component effect was interrogated to screen out
PEG-b-PBSe diblock copolymer due to its favorable self-assembly controllability and high drug loading of
camptothecin (CPT) and doxorubicin (DOX) that had synergistic antitumor property. Facile visible lightinduced diselenide metathesis and regeneration was employed to crosslink nanocarriers for the first
time. The dual drug-loaded crosslinked micelles (CPT/DOX-CCM) were stable in physiological conditions
with minimal drug leakage, possessing extended blood circulation, whereas hand-in-hand dual drug
release was significantly accelerated in tumor's redox microenvironments. In vitro cytotoxicity evaluation
and in vivo tumor suppression with low dosage drugs further demonstrated the favorable potency of the
redox-responsive nanoplatform in tumor combination chemotherapy.

1. Introduction
Biocompatible materials with size range from nanometers to
micrometers have been frequently employed in biomedical applications (e.g. therapeutics, sensing and imaging), which are generally fabricated from lipids, proteins, carbohydrates as well as
natural and synthetic polymers [1e5]. Among these, synthetic
polymeric nanostructures tend to be more stable than low molecular weight surfactants, possessing tailorable components and ondemand functions to meet practical needs [6]. The morphological
feature of polymeric nanoparticles containing hydrophobic core
and hydrophilic shell makes them suitable for nanomedicine [7,8].
In addition, it is well recognized that tumors have underdeveloped
blood microvessels with many pores, which are permeable to
nanoparticles, including polymeric nanoparticles, and that is socalled enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect [9]. In this
context, polymeric nanocarriers with long blood circulation and
enough physiological stability would be favorable to accumulate in
tumors by passive targeting, and thus it is quite attractive to
develop nanocarriers with these properties [10].
Whereas some issues of polymeric nanocarriers are still unresolved, which significantly impede their advanced applications
[11]. Particularly, the structural integrity and limited drug loading
stability in physiological conditions have been extensively focused.
Upon intravenous injection, drug-loaded polymeric nanoparticles
subjected with high dilution and severe shear force are inclined to
dissociate into polymer unimers, which is accompanied with undesirable drug leakage prior to accessing the targeted lesions.
Moreover, when polymer unimers are frequently captured by other
constituents in blood circulation (e.g. blood proteins, membranes
and surfaces), the dissociation will accelerate due to the equilibrium shifting towards the unimer state. Thus, the nature of physical
encapsulation of drugs within polymeric nanocarriers will

unavoidably exhibit premature drug leakage and shorten the blood
circulation life. To address the plight for drug-loaded nanocarriers,
many covalently drug-modified delivery systems have been
developed to alleviate these problems [12,13], but the advantages of
covalently linked drug systems have been compromised by the
sophisticated synthesis, limited scale-up production potency, high
cost, unspecific drug release, and changed therapeutic activities
[14].
Hence, various innovative strategies have been developed to
improve the stability of non-covalent drug-loaded polymeric
nanocarriers. Thereinto, shell cross-linking and core cross-linking
strategies were frequently employed to enhance the stability of
drug-loaded polymeric nanoparticles, achieving efficient drug delivery even at low micellar concentrations [15e19]. Many crosslinking methods were presented, including addition of bifunctional
reagents [20e24], direct reaction of pendent functionalities (eg.
thiol groups, silxane groups, alkoxyamine groups and boronic
ester) [25e31], or polymerization of double carbon bonds within
nanoparticles [32]. However, some limitations may prevent the
further application, such as unreacted reagents, possible side reactions and byproducts as well as damage to the payloads [7]. In
view of these issues, the ideal crosslinking profile is supposed to be
no extra reagents, and the process is mild and suitable for scale-up
formulation [33]. In this respect, light undoubtedly possesses
distinctive advantages such as facile operation, spatiotemporal and
remote control, no external additives, and wavelength selection.
Many conceptually advanced systems have been reported using UV
light to crosslink and stabilize polymeric nanoparticles [17,34e36].
But UV light was restricted for its low penetration depth and
phototoxicity [37]. Recently, Xu and coworkers pioneered that mild
visible light could induce dynamic cleavage and exchange of diselenide bonds (Se-Se) [38,39]. Park et al. reported in situ diselenidecrosslinked micelles for ROS-responsive drug delivery, which were
spontaneously derived from selenol-bearing triblock copolymers to
form the crosslinking shell, exhibiting excellent physiological stability [28]. Hence we envisage that visible light-sensitive dynamic
diselenide bonds may be applicable in crosslinking chemistry for
biomedicine using visible light as a mild and convenient method.
On the other hand, various tumors exhibit heterogeneity of
cellular environments. Thus plenty of stimuli-responsive polymeric
nanoparticles have been extensively developed to accomplish
controlled drug release at the target sites [40e44]. Notably, glutathione (GSH) tripeptide content in the cytosol and cell nucleus
ranges from 2 to 10 mM, which is about ~1000-fold higher than that
in body fluids and extracellular matrices (2e10 mM) [40,45],
arousing the booming development of reduction-responsive drug
delivery systems [46e50]. In addition, the overproduced reactive
oxygen species (ROS) within tumor cells in disease state may
disrupt cellular homeostasis, giving rise to pathological conditions,
which is also a characteristic of tumors [51e53]. The ROS content in
tumor cells is evaluated up to 100 mM, whereas the concentration of
the most abundant and stable nonradical ROS, H2O2, is just around
20 nM in normal tissues [54]. Thus ROS has been also utilized as a
trigger to mediate intracellular ROS-responsive controlled drug
release [55e58]. In addition, diselenide bonds were confirmed to
be sensitive to both GSH and ROS, which can be both employed to
mediate drug release within tumors, possessing remarkable advantages [59,60]. Therefore, diselenide bonds have gained much
attention in nanomedicine during the past few years [61,62].
Nevertheless, the reported redox-sensitive polymeric nanocarriers
seldom resolved the matter of physiological instability and premature drug release.
Moreover, because of the drug resistance in tumor therapy
[63e65], especially in single drug therapy, combination therapy
was proved to be quite effective when using antitumor drugs with
different working mechanisms, thereby decreasing the developing
likelihood of resistant cancer cells [66e69]. Among these, many
efforts have been focused to demonstrate potent anticancer combinations with topoisomerase (top) I and II inhibitors as one of the
most widely explored categories. Top I inhibitors hinder DNA
replication and enhance the activity of top II, further sensitizing the
cancer cells to top II inhibitors. Camptothecin (CPT, top I inhibitor)
and doxorubicin (DOX, top II inhibitor) were demonstrated to
inhibit cancer cells synergistically [70]. Additionally, each drug can
be employed at its optimal dose in combination chemotherapy to
minimize intolerable side effects [71]. Hence, polymeric nanocarriers could transport multiple drugs into tumor in an appropriate ratio to overcome limitations of single drug therapy [72e74].
Multiple drug-loaded polymeric nanoparticles render an ideal
platform for the co-delivery of different drugs for tumor combination chemotherapy.
In this work, diselenide-rich amphiphilic diblock copolymers
were fabricated to encapsulate two antitumor drugs with synergistic therapeutic effects, CPT and DOX, then visible light-induced
dynamic exchange of diselenide bonds in the hydrophobic core
promoted the formation of core crosslinking micelles, CPT/DOXCCM, in which the effect of polymer hydrophobic components
was discussed in the self-assembly and drug formulation. This mild
crosslinking strategy made the platform robust and stable with
minimal drug leakage in physiological conditions, prolonging blood
circulation of nanocarriers. Upon intravenous administration,
hand-in-hand release of CPT and DOX was accelerated significantly
in tumor's redox microenvironments. In vivo analysis demonstrated
the substantial tumor suppressing potency of the nanocarriers
using low dosage of combined drugs.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
Sodium borohydride, selenium powder, 30% H2O2, dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and all other
organic solvents used in this study were available from the
Guangzhou Chemical Reagent Company. Camptothecin (CPT) was
obtained from Pengzhou Maoyuan Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd
and used as received. Indocyanine green (ICG), doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX$HCl), 11-bromo-1-undecanol, 2-bromoethanol,
and 4-bromobenzyl alcohol were available from Aladdin Industrial
Corporation. Fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin, streptomycin and
RPMI 1640 were purchased from GIBCO and used as received.
Lysotracker Green was obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.
Water used in this study was deionized with a Milli-QSP reagent
water system (Millipore) to a specific resistivity of 18.4 MU cm.
PEG45-based RAFT agent [75] and three kinds of diselenide diols
precursors, including di-(1-hydroxyethylene) diselenide [76], di-(1-
hydroxyundecene) diselenide [59], and di-(4,1-hydroxybenzylene)
diselenide [77] were synthesized according to reported literatures.
2.2. Synthesis of diselenide-rich amphiphilic diblock copolymers
Synthetic routes employed for the preparation of diseleniderich samples were shown in Scheme S1. Reversible additionfragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization technique
and facile post-modification was employed. Typically, PEG-based
RAFT agent (100 mg, 0.043 mmol), methacrylic acid (185 mg,
2.15 mmol), and AIBN (1.4 mg, 0.008 mmol) were charged into a
glass ampoule containing 2 mL isopropanol as solvents. The
ampoule was then degassed via three freeze-pump-thaw cycles
and flame-sealed under vacuum. The ampoule was then immersed
into an oil bath thermostated at 70 C to start the polymerization.
42 S. Zhai et al. / Biomaterials 121 (2017) 41e54
After 2 h, the polymerization was quenched into liquid nitrogen.
The mixture was precipitated into an excess of diethyl ether to
generate residues, the residues were dissolved in dichloromethane
and precipitated into diethyl ether, which was repeated for three
times. The product was dried in a vacuum oven overnight at room
temperature. The degree of polymerization for PMAA block was
determined to be 30 based on 1
H NMR analysis (Fig. S1). After that,
PEG-b-PBSe was synthesized by mixing PEG-b-PMAA (132 mg,
0.03 mmol), di-(4,1-hydroxybenzylene) diselenide (666 mg,
1.8 mmol), EDC$HCl (258.8 mg, 1.35 mmol), DMAP (109.9 mg,
0.9 mmol) and 10 ml dry DMF into a glass ampoule. The ampoule
was then degassed via three freeze-pump-thaw cycles and flamesealed under vacuum. After stirring at room temperature for 24 h,
the solution was precipitated into an excess of diethyl ether, and the
above dissolution-precipitation cycle was repeated for three times.
The final product was dried in a vacuum oven overnight at room
temperature, and the composition was analyzed by 1
H NMR. In
addition, PEG-b-PESe and PEG-b-PUSe were prepared according to
similar procedures.
2.3. Fabrication and characterization of core cross-linked micelles
PEG-b-PBSe (2 mg) was dissolved in DMSO (1 mL), then
deionized water was added dropwise under vigorous stirring. After
further stirring for 1 h, DMSO was removed by dialysis (cellulose
membrane, MW cutoff: 3500 Da) against deionized water for 24 h
to afford non-crosslinked micelles (NCM). The aqueous dispersion
of NCM was irradiated by a 25 W incandescent light bulb without
filter at room temperature at 182e184 Lux for 0.5 h to fabricate core
crosslinked micelles (CCM) [39]. The obtained CCM dispersions
were tested by dynamic light scattering (DLS, Malvern Zetasizer
Nano-ZS 90, UK) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL
JEM-2100, Janapa).
Both NCM and CCM samples were dissolved in DMF after freezedrying, then the change of light scattering intensity and size distribution was analyzed by DLS. The stability of CCM was investigated in 50% fetal bovine serum (FBS), or SDS (2.5 mg/mL) at 37 C,
the change of scattering intensity was monitored as a function of
incubation time using DLS.
2.4. Preparation of combined drug-loaded CCM
CPT and DOX dual drug-loaded micelles were prepared in selfassembly process. Briefly, PEG-b-PBSe (2 mg), DOX$HCl (0.5 mg),
triethylamine (100 mL) and CPT (0.5 mg) were dissolved in DMSO
for 1 h, then deionized water was added dropwise under vigorous
stirring. After dialyzing against water, visible light irradiation was
applied to fabricate the drug-loaded core crosslinked micelles (CPT/
DOX-CCM). The drug loading content was measured by UVeVis
spectroscopy. Firstly, calibration curves of CPT and DOX in DMSO
were determined by values at 370 nm and 485 nm respectively
using a UVevis spectrophotometer (Lambda 35, PerkinElmer, USA).
Then, the aqueous dispersion of CPT/DOX-CCM was lyophilized and
dissolved in DMSO. Finally, the absorption spectra were acquired to
determine the drug concentration based on above calibration
curves.
2.5. Redox dual-responsive combined drug release
The redox dual-responsive degradation was in situ monitored
by DLS. Typically, micellar dispersions were treated with GSH (0,
2 mM, 5 mM and 10 mM) or H2O2 (0, 100 mM, 3 mM and 30 mM) at
37 C in 0.1 M PBS, respectively. The change of relative light scattering intensity was in situ recorded by DLS. In addition, in vitro
accumulative drug release was evaluated, micellar dispersion was
placed in a dialysis membrane bag containing different content of
GSH (0, 2 mM, 5 mM and 10 mM) or H2O2 (0, 100 mM, 3 mM and
30 mM), and dialyzed against the same media at 37 C respectively.
At predetermined time intervals, the release medium was refreshed
by transferring the tube to the fresh medium. The amount of drug
release was determined according to the calibration curve.
2.6. Cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking
Human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and mouse mammary
tumor cell line EMT-6 were employed in this study. MCF-7 cells
were cultured in DMEM (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), EMT-6 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640
(GIBCO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 units/mL), and streptomycin (100 mg/mL) at 37 C in
CO2/air (5:95) in a humidified incubator.
Cellular internalization of CPT/DOX-CCM in cancer cells and
intracellular drug release was evaluated by confocal laser scanning
microscopy (Carl Zeiss LSM 510META system) using EMT-6 as
model cells. The late endosome and lysosomes were stained with
Lysotracker Green. EMT-6 cells were plated onto cell culture dishes
(1  106 per well), then CPT/DOX-CCM were added, upon incubating for 2 h, 6 h and 10 h, cells were stained with Lysotracker
Green for 30 min before imaging. DOX and Lysotracker Green were
excited by 488 nm laser irradiation, and the emission detection
channels were set to be LP560 nm and 505e530 nm, respectively.
2.7. In vitro cytotoxicity evaluation
The cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT assay. MCF-7 cells or
EMT-6 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (5  103 per well, 100 mL)
and incubated overnight at 37 C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The original medium was refreshed and added with DOX,
CPT, CCM and CPT/DOX-CCM at predetermined content and incubated for 24 h. Then the medium in each well was replaced with
fresh cell culture medium, and MTT reagent was added to each well
and incubated for 6 h until purple precipitates were visible. Finally,
DMSO (100 mL) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 37 C for 15 min or until all the crystals were dissolved. The
absorbance intensity at 570 nm was recorded and the cytotoxicity
was expressed as a percentage of the control.
2.8. Cell apoptosis detection
Quantification of apoptosis was detected as previous description
[78]. Cells were seeded in six-well plates (1.0 mL of cell suspension
per well) at 2  105 cells/mL and allowed to grow for 24 h. Drugfree CCM, DOX, CPT and CPT/DOX-CCM were added to each well
and incubated with cells for 24 h. After the treatment, cells were
collected and stained with Annexin V-FITC/PI. Each sample was
analyzed by a flow cytometry (FACS Canto™ II, BD, USA).
Compensation was used wherever necessary. Files were collected
of 10,000 gated events and analyzed with FCS V3 software.
2.9. In vivo blood circulation evaluation
The fabrication of ICG-loaded micelles was similar to that of
drug-loaded micelles. Blood circulation was measured by drawing
25 mL blood from the tail vein of the EMT6 tumor bearing mice after
intravenous injection of ICG, ICG-NCM and ICG-CCM (1 mg ICG/kg,
200 mL) respectively. Each blood sample was dissolved in 175 mL of
Lysis buffer (1% Sodium Dodecyl Sulfonate, 1% Triton X-100, 40 mM
Tris-cetate) and the fluorescence intensities were recorded using
ELASA (excitation wavelength: 785 nm, emission wavelength:
805 nm, n ¼ 3) [79]. The blank blood samples were also detected to
S. Zhai et al. / Biomaterials 121 (2017) 41e54 43
subtract the auto-fluorescence of blood.
2.10. Animal models
For the tumor model of back transplantation, EMT-6 cells
(1  106
) in solution (100 mL) were injected into the flank region of
female Balb/c mice, aged 4e5 weeks. Seven days after cell inoculation, the mice were used when tumors reached a size of
approximately 60 mm3
. All the animal experiments were performed following a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (South China Normal University,
Guangzhou, China).
2.11. In vivo biodistribution of CCM
After molting, EMT-6 tumor bearing mice were intravenously
injected with ICG, ICG-NCM, ICG-CCM (ICG equivalent concentration at 1 mg ICG per kg, 200 mL) and imaged at different time points
(0.5 h, 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 24 h) with the infrared imaging system (Odyssey
LI-COR, USA. lex ¼ 785 nm) [80]. To measure the distribution in
tissue, at post-injection 24 h mice were sacrificed, and the major
organs and tumors were collected and imaged.
2.12. In vivo antitumor effect and systematic toxicity evaluation
The biological effects of free drugs and dual drug loaded micelles were parallelly examined in EMT6 tumor bearing Balb/c female mice. The mice were randomly divided into five groups
(n ¼ 10), and injected with PBS, DOX, CPT, CPT/DOX-NCM, and CPT/
DOX-CCM at a dose of 1 mg CPT or DOX equivalent per kg every four
days in 24 days respectively. The dimension of tumors was
measured using a caliper every four days and calculated as
Volume ¼ (tumor length  (tumor width)2
)/2. Relative tumor
volumes were calculated according to V/V0 (V0 was the tumor
volume when the treatment was initiated). The body weight of
mice was recorded during the whole administration process. Mice
were finally euthanized, and the main organs were harvested for
histology analysis by hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E staining) [81].
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of visible light-induced core crosslinked
micelles
In this work, amphiphilic diblock copolymers with repeated
diselenide bonds in different hydrophobic side chains were synthesized by reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT)
polymerization and facile post-modification (Scheme S1). Firstly,
PEG-b-PMAA was synthesized by direct RAFT polymerization of
methacrylic acid (MAA) in the presence of PEG45-based RAFT agent,
then modified with three different diselenide-containing diols,
including di-(1-hydroxyethylene) diselenide, di-(1-
hydroxyundecene) diselenide, and di-(4,1-hydroxybenzylene) diselenide, respectively, affording three distinct amphiphilic diblock
copolymers with diselenide bonds in the hydrophobic side chains,
specifically, PEG-b-PESe, PEG-b-PUSe, and PEG-b-PBSe. The degree
of polymerization (DP) of PMAA block was determined to be 30 by
1
H NMR analysis, and the post-modification efficiency was all >95%
calculated by the proton integration of PEG and that of modified
diols, approximately 29 repeating units were decorated in the side
chain of each sample (Fig. S1, Table 1).
Amphiphilic polymers would self-assemble into discrete nanostructures in water. As a comparison, solvent displacement method
was employed parallelly for the aqueous self-assembly of three
kinds of diselenide-rich polymers, which had different hydrophobic
segments and identical hydrophilic PEG moieties. TEM analysis
confirmed their self-assembled morphology and size distribution,
in which the self-assembly controllability for both PEG-b-PESe and
PEG-b-PUSe was relatively poor (Fig. 1a, b), while PEG-b-PBSe micelles exhibited quite uniform and spherical nanostructures
(Fig. 1c). Typically, the hydrodynamic diameter of PEG-b-PBSe micelles was further determined to be ~129 nm by dynamic light
scattering (DLS) analysis, and two other was ~583 nm and ~202 nm,
respectively. Notably, PEG-b-PBSe micelles had the narrowest size
distribution in dry state and water (Fig. 1c, d, Table 1). Furthermore,
the storage stability was examined for three kinds of polymeric
micelles in a duration of 28 days (Fig. 1e, f). The diameter and size
distribution values of PEG-b-PBSe micelles showed the least
change, possessing relatively good storage stability. PEG-b-PBSe has
short alkyl chain and rigid phenyl groups in the hydrophobic
segment, which is more likely to form compact p-p interaction
among phenyl groups, thus exhibiting smaller particle size and low
dispersity. On the contrary, the self-assembly of both PEG-b-PESe
and PEG-b-PUSe no matter with short or long alkyl side chains was
not ideal (Fig. 1).
Inspired by the dynamic exchange of diselenide bonds triggered
by visible light [38,39], we envisage that diselenide bonds may be
applied in crosslinking chemistry using visible light as a mild way.
Thus polymeric micelles of PEG-b-PBSe were further interrogated
for the visible light-induced microstructural transformation. The
micellar dispersion was irradiated with a 25 W incandescent light
bulb without any addition of catalyst. As shown in Fig. 2a, DLS results showed no significant difference, and TEM analysis also
demonstrated the persistent spherical nanostructure compared
with non-irradiated one (Fig. 2a inset vs Fig. 1c).
To further verify whether the visible light treatment has led to
micellar crosslinking, the treated micellar dispersion was freezedried and then dispersed into a good solvent (DMF) for the whole
polymer. As shown in Fig. 2b, the size distribution curve recorded
for the visible light-treated micelles in DMF exhibited a monomodal distribution with an <Dh> of 863 nm and a dispersity index
of 0.57, which demonstrated that crosslinking occured and the
structural integrity of micelles was maintained in a swelling state in
DMF; otherwise, non-crosslinked micelles would dissociate into
unimers. Whereas for the non-irradiated micelles, it exhibited an
<Dh> of 7.6 nm, indicating the disintegration of micelles into
molecularly dissolved unimers. These results confirmed that visible
light-induced dynamic exchange of diselenide bonds within the
micellar core led to effective crosslinking, affording the resultant
core crosslinked micelles (CCM). Compared with the pristine noncrosslinked micelles (NCM), the physical stability of micelles was
greatly improved via visible light-induced core crosslinking. The
crosslinking mechanism was tentatively proposed to result from
visible light-induced diselenide metathesis and recombination of
selenide radicals among different polymer chains, affording diselenide linkages as the crosslinking moieties in the resultant
micellar core (Scheme 1). On the other hand, strong pep interactions between phenyl groups in the hydrophobic core were
expected to make the micellar core much more compact and the
crosslinking much more effective.
Then, the stability of NCM and CCM was further evaluated by
DLS analysis under simulated physiological conditions such as
blood circulation [82]. Upon treating with 50% fetal bovine serum
(FBS), the size of NCM increased slightly to 176 nm in the initial
30 min incubation, then swelled significantly up to over 600 nm
with broad distribution at 24 h, indicating the formation of large
aggregates (Fig. 2c, d). However, CCM still kept comparable uniformity and narrow size distribution compared with the initial state
during the whole process. Additionally, the stability of NCM and
44 S. Zhai et al. / Biomaterials 121 (2017) 41e54
CCM was examined in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS), a strong ionic surfactant, which is well-accepted to have
strong micelle-disrupting potency and can disintegrate polymeric
micelles efficiently [20]. Low content of SDS can accelerate the
exchange rate between micelles and unimers, while high SDS level
will destabilize polymeric micelles [83]. Both NCM and CCM
aqueous dispersion was mixed with SDS (2.5 mg/mL), the size
distribution was recorded at different time intervals (30 min and
24 h). The size background of SDS dispersion was below the
detection limit of DLS, thus the disappearance of the previous size
distribution signal of NCM could reflect the dynamic associationdissociation of NCM, whereas the constant particle size of CCM
under long-term SDS treatment indicated that CCM remained
intact (Fig. 2e, f). In summary, visible light-induced core crosslinking of the diselenide-rich micelles were achieved, endowing
the resultant core crosslinked micelles with excellent physiological
stability and potential responsive linkages at the crosslinking
points.
3.2. Redox dual-responsive combined drug release

peaks of CPT and DOX were observed in the spectrum of CPT/DOXCCM, indicating the successful formulation of both CPT and DOX
within the resultant nanocarriers (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, compared
with the absorption spectra of samples without visible light treatment, there was no detectable change to demonstrate possible drug
degradation during the visible light-induced crosslinking process
(Fig. S2).
The drug loading capability of three kinds of polymers with
different hydrophobic components were further interrogated, PEGb-PBSe had the highest loading content for both CPT and DOX,
specifically 15.6 wt% and 12.2 wt% respectively, whereas the values
for both PEG-b-PESe and PEG-b-PUSe were below 6 wt% (Table 1).
The hydrophobic benzyl groups of PEG-b-PBSe were in favor of the
interaction between drugs and hydrophobic matrix, which significantly facilitated the high encapsulation of combined drugs
[84e86]. Then visible light was employed to crosslink CPT/DOXNCM, affording CPT/DOX-loaded core crosslinked micelles (CPT/
DOX-CCM). The hydrodynamic diameter of CPT/DOX-CCM was
determined to be ~116 nm, exhibiting slight decrease compared
with that of CPT/DOX-NCM and maintaining persistent spherical
nanostructures (Fig. 3b).
As demonstrated before, diselenide bonds would be fractured
and generate hydrophilic selenol in the presence of GSH, or hydrophilic selenic acid after reacting with ROS (Scheme 1) [87].
Considering the redox dual-responsive feature of diselenide bonds
in the crosslinking moieties, then the redox sensitivity of CCM was
explored in the presence of GSH and H2O2, which were both highly
expressed in tumors. The redox dual-responsiveness of CCM was
interrogated by DLS and TEM analysis. The light scattering intensity
of CCM was monitored upon incubation with different content of
GSH and H2O2, indicating less than 5% decrease in PBS, which
revealed favorable stability of CCM in physiological condition
(Fig. S3aeb). In contrast, upon incubation with 10 mM GSH, the
scattering intensity of micelles decreased to 39% at 120 min, and as
low as 16% at 240 min. On the other hand, CCM can also be
degraded in the presence of H2O2. TEM tests showed redox dualresponsive nanostructural transformation during above processes
(Fig. S3cef). Upon incubating in redox conditions, CCM began to
shrink and break down (Fig. S3c,e), and almost degraded
completely after 200 min incubation (Fig. S3d,f). The hydrophobicto-hydrophilic transition of micellar core was proposed due to the
cleavage of crosslinked diselenide bonds into hydrophilic selenol or
selenic acid in redox conditions, thus leading to the disassembly of
CCM in tumor-related redox microenvironments.
Herein, the redox dual-responsive drug release was examined
for CPT/DOX-CCM. In vitro DOX release was investigated in the
presence of GSH or H2O2 respectively, exhibiting accumulative DOX
release up to 99.7% upon 24 h incubation with 10 mM GSH,
whereas, only ~29.2% drug leakage was observed for DOX in the
presence of 2 mM GSH, which was corresponding with physiological
conditions (Fig. 3c). Comparable results were obtained for DOX
release upon treating with H2O2, displaying 42.5% DOX release for
24 h in the presence of 100 mM H2O2 (Fig. 3d). In addition, slightly
delayed CPT release was observed due to the solubility difference
between CPT and DOX, exhibiting ~89.3% at 24 h, 10 mM GSH, and
~36.6% for 100 mM H2O2 respectively (Fig. S4). Hence we envisaged
that combined drugs of CPT and DOX were on-demand released in a
nearly equal molar ratio. These results were also in good agreement
with the proved redox responsiveness of CCM. Thus the diseleniderich crosslinking barrier in the hydrophobic core not only significantly improved the physiological stability of nanocarriers, but also
effectively inhibited drug diffusion and leakage from the

nanocarriers, suggesting potential excellent blood retention property. Whereas in tumors, hand-in-hand drug release of CPT and
DOX was achieved efficiently, which laid a solid foundation for
tumor combination chemotherapy.
3.3. Cellular uptake and in vitro cytotoxicity of CPT/DOX-CCM
The cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking of CPT/DOXCCM were determined by flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). It was observed that CPT/DOX-CCM could
be internalized effectively by EMT-6 cells, and the fluorescence of
internalized DOX increased gradually as a function of incubation
time up to 10 h determined by flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 4a, b).
In addition, The kinetics of cellular uptake was further evaluated by
the quantification from CLSM analysis (Fig. 4c). Meanwhile, the late
endosomes and lysosomes were stained with Lysotracker Green for
colocalization. Upon 2 h incubation, substantial cellular internalization into EMT-6 cells was observed, and CPT/DOX-CCM were
mainly colocalized with Lysotracker Green, exhibiting merged
yellow fluorescence, which suggested that drug-loaded micelles
were mainly located in endolysosomes during the initial stage.
Furthermore, upon 10 h treatment with CPT/DOX-CCM, the red
fluorescence of DOX was found to be around nuclear membrane, or
even within the nuclei. The punctuated distribution of DOX fluorescence in the cytoplasm and the nuclei indicated the remarkable
endosomal escape capability of CPT/DOX-CCM, which accompanied
with redox dual-responsive disassembly of micelles as well as
controlled drug release, resulting in considerable nucleic accumulation of drugs [88,89].
Subsequently, MTT assay was employed to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the combined drug delivery system. As shown in
Fig. 5a,b, drug-free CCM of PEG-b-PBSe exhibited negligible cytotoxicity against both MCF-7 and EMT-6 cells, with >85% cell
viability at a micellar content even up to 300 mg/mL, which suggested that diselenide-rich PEG-b-PBSe had good biocompatibility.
Then the cytotoxicity of CPT/DOX-CCM was evaluated against two
cell lines in the same profile, demonstrating remarkable decrease of
cellular viability against two cell lines compared with either CPT or
DOX alone (Fig. 5c, d).
Furthermore, the cell apoptosis and necrosis after drug administration was analyzed by FACS with Annexin V-FITC/PI double
staining (Fig. 5e). The results showed that CPT/DOX-CCM treatment

S. Zhai et al. / Biomaterials 121 (2017) 41e54 47
induced cell late apoptosis/necrosis more significantly compared
with CPT or DOX alone (Fig. 5f, g), which suggested that the synergistic therapeutic effect of CPT and DOX was responsible for the
improved therapeutic efficiency of CPT/DOX-CCM. Thus the drug
coformulation and redox dual-sensitive potency of nanocarriers
conserved the potential activity of drug pairs and ensured simultaneous exposure within tumor cells, which was the premise to
have excellent in vivo antitumor efficacy.
3.4. In vivo blood circulation of ICG-CCM
To further interrogate in vivo physiological stability of
diselenide-rich crosslinked micelles, indocyanine green (ICG) was
used as a NIR dye to be encapsulated within the CCM. The hydrodynamic size distribution and spherical morphological properties
of ICG-loaded NCM (ICG-NCM) and ICG-loaded CCM (ICG-CCM)
were similar with aforementioned drug-loaded micelles
(Fig. S5aec). EMT-6 tumor bearing mice were intravenously injected with free ICG, ICG-NCM, and ICG-CCM respectively. As shown in
Fig. 6a, for free ICG-treated mice, the fluorescence signals distributed extensively in liver tissue and less in tumor tissue after 1 h
post-injection, and almost completely disappeared after 6 h. On the
contrary, the fluorescence signals in tumor tissue strengthened
with the increase of time interval, and reached a peak after 3 h
post-injection of ICG-CCM. After 6 h, the signal in tumor tissue still
could be detected in the ICG-CCM treated mice, which was much
stronger than that of ICG-NCM. Furthermore, remarkable fluorescence was still observed at the tumor sites for the mice treated with
ICG-CCM for 24 h, while it was undetectable for ICG-NCM. After
24 h post-injection, the ex vivo fluorescence images of major organs
and tumors were obtained (Fig. 6b,c). This result indicated that ICGCCM were successfully accumulated within tumor sites, and the
potential drug release within tumor lasted even more than 24 h
after drug administration [90]. While the mice treated with free ICG
showed negligible fluorescence at the tumor site, which is due to
much faster clearance of free ICG from body compared with polymeric nanocarriers. Furthermore, the half-life of ICG-CCM in blood
circulation was determined to be ~3.82 h, which was remarkably
longer than that of free ICG and ICG-NCM, ~0.13 h and ~1.19 h
respectively (Fig. 6d), demonstrating that CCM could improve the
blood retention time of encapsulated cargoes in blood circulation
compared with both free drug and non-crosslinked nanocarriers. In
short, both ICG-NCM and ICG-CCM were observed to accumulate at
the tumor sites, but the tumor fluorescence regression for ICG-CCM
was slowest compared with free ICG and ICG-NCM, which was
consistent with the blood circulation and tumor retention properties. Thus the features of improved physiological stability and
prolonged blood circulation contributed to selective accumulation
and long-term retention of CCM at the tumor sites [90,91].

3.5. In vivo antitumor efficacy evaluation
The dual drug-loaded diselenide-rich crosslinked micelles, CPT/
DOX-CCM, were determined be slightly negatively charged
(Table 1), thus may be potent for intravenous tumor administration
[92]. Therefore, the therapeutic effect was evaluated by intravenous

treatment of mice bearing subcutaneous EMT-6 breast tumors. The
mice were treated with PBS, CPT, DOX, CPT/DOX-NCM and CPT/
DOX-CCM every four days in 24 days (Fig. 7a). Compared with
single drug treatment by free DOX or CPT as well as pure PBS,
combination therapy was found to significantly inhibit tumor
growth. Moreover, CPT/DOX-CCM showed better tumor suppression effect than CPT/DOX-NCM group due to the prolonged blood
circulation time of CCM and enhanced tumor accumulation (Fig. 7b,
c and Fig. 6). Furthermore, H&E analysis revealed that CPT/DOXCCM treated tumors had much more pyknotic cells with highly
condensed nuclei, which were considered to be apoptotic or dead
cells (Fig. 7d). The high in vivo antitumor therapeutic efficacy most
probably resulted from the integrated advantages of CPT/DOX-CCM,
including high drug loading content, improved physiological stability, extended blood circulation, effective tumor accumulation,
and combined drug release at tumor sites. The body weight of mice
treated with CPT/DOX-CCM had no significant changes during the
whole treatment process, suggesting unobvious systematic toxicity
(Fig. S6). In addition, there was no obvious pathological changes of
the main organs in CPT/DOX-CCM treated group, which further
indicated that CPT/DOX-CCM had minimal in vivo toxicity (Fig. S7).
The low dosage of combined drug treatment was beneficial for
reducing side effects but not sacrificing the therapeutic efficacy
[73], which further highlighted the comprehensive advantages of
nanocarriers. Thus, in vitro and in vivo analysis demonstrated that it
was highly promising to employ current diselenide-rich

4. Conclusion
In summary, three kinds of diselenide-rich amphiphilic diblock
copolymers were fabricated with repeating diselenide bonds in
distinct hydrophobic segments. Optimized hydrophobic composition with rigid phenyl groups within hydrophobic block was
beneficial for the self-assembly controllability and high drug
loading. Facile visible light-induced core crosslinking was demonstrated for the first time, in which diselenide linkages were located

at the crosslinking moieties, exhibiting the feature of redox dualresponsive degradation. High content of CPT and DOX were
encapsulated within the nanocarriers to afford dual drug-loaded
core crosslinked micelles, CPT/DOX-CCM. Controlled combined
drug release of CPT and DOX was demonstrated in tumor-related
redox microenvironments. In vitro and in vivo results displayed
the potency of tumor cell killing and significant suppression of
tumor growth without any detectable side effects. The diseleniderich nanocarriers with multiple properties of high drug loading,
visible light-induced in situ crosslinking, improved physiological
stability, optimized pharmacokinetics, and tumor-specific combined drug release are promising in the delivery of multiple drugs,
imaging agents as well as the inhibition of drug resistant tumors.
