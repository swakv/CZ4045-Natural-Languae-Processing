Objectives—The aim of the study was to assess the sonographic feasibility of measuring the fetal pancreas and its normal development throughout pregnancy.
Methods—We conducted a cross-sectional prospective study between 19 and 36
weeks’ gestation. The study included singleton pregnancies with normal pregnancy
follow-up. The pancreas circumference was measured. The first 90 cases were tested
to assess feasibility.
Results—Two hundred ninety-seven fetuses of nondiabetic mothers were recruited
during a 3-year period. The overall satisfactory visualization rate was 61.6%. The
intraobserver and interobserver variability had high interclass correlation coefficients
of of 0.964 and 0.967, respectively. A cubic polynomial regression described best the
correlation of pancreas circumference with gestational age (r
2 5 0.744; P < .001)
and significant correlations also with abdominal circumference and estimated fetal
weight (Pearson r 5 0.829 and 0.812, respectively; P < .001). Modeled pancreas circumference percentiles for each week of gestation were calculated. During the study
period, we detected 2 cases with overgrowth syndrome and 1 case with an annular
pancreas.
Conclusions—In this study, we assessed the feasibility of sonography for measuring
the fetal pancreas and established a normal reference range for the fetal pancreas circumference throughout pregnancy. This database can be helpful when investigating
fetomaternal disorders that can involve its normal development.

Fetal biometry is an important tool in evaluating fetal organs’
normal development. Growth in the normal range reflects, in
most cases, normal anatomy and functionality. Abnormal fetal
pancreas development and growth can be the result of various pregnancy complications, such as intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)
and diabetes mellitus, or can be a part of genetic syndromes related
to abnormal growth or development of the pancreas, which itself can
have implications on fetal growth.
The sonographic literature concerning the fetal pancreas is very
scarce. The only 2 prenatal studies, which are more than 25 years
old, were limited to evaluation of the feasibility of sonographic visualization.1,2 They lacked reports about intraobserver and interobserver
variability, clear details regarding the technical steps necessary for visualization, and presentation of a normal reference range throughout
pregnancy. As such, their clinical contribution is very limited. Moreover, most of the prenatal sonographic textbooks ignore this organ
or, at best, include very scant information. The absence of updated
prenatal literature and the immense technological improvements in
ultrasound machines since the last studies spurred us to investigate
this neglected organ, the functionality of which has an important
impact on fetal and adult normal development.3,4

ORIGINAL RESEARCH
The aim of the study was to assess the sonographic
feasibility of measuring the fetal pancreas, to construct
normal modeled reference intervals of fetal pancreas circumference per centiles, and to evaluate the correlation
with other fetal growth parameters and eventual pathologic conditions. These data could serve as a useful complementary tool when investigating fetal anomalies
coexisting with or caused by abnormal congenital development of the pancreas.
Materials and Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional prospective study during
routine pregnancy follow-up of women who attended
the ultrasound units at the Chaim Sheba Medical Center
and the Women’s Health Center of Maccabi Health
Services between 19 and 35 weeks’ gestation. The study
protocol was approved by the local institutional Ethics
Committees of both centers. All of the women were
informed and consented to the extra evaluation of the
fetal pancreas.
The study included nondiabetic women with a singleton pregnancy who fulfilled the following criteria: (1)
a history of regular menses with accurate first-trimester
dating based on sonographic measurement of the
crown-rump length; (2) absence of any malformations;
(3) normal pregnancy follow-up without other maternal
or placental complications; and (4) a normal perinatal
outcome. Each patient was examined only once during
the study by 2 examiners (Z.K. and Y.G.) with 25 and
15 years of experience in prenatal sonography, respectively. A commercially available Voluson 730 Expert or
E8 Expert machine (GE Healthcare, Kretz Ultrasound,
Zipf, Austria) equipped with an abdominal 4–8-MHz
curvilinear transducer was used. The preset was set usually on the “routine obstetric” setting with minor personal adjustments. They included a single focal zone, high
tissue harmonic imaging, Cross XBeam compound resolution imaging between 1 and 3, and speckle reduction
imaging II between 3 and 5.
To obtain the best acoustic window of the pancreas,
we start by scanning the fetal upper abdomen with a
transverse anteroposterior plane at the level of the stomach and the umbilicoportal complex, including the point
of drainage of the main portal vein. The spine is preferably positioned between 5 and 7 o’clock (Figure 1A). In
the next step, the transducer is inclined posteriorly to
display the whole pancreas. The anterolateral edge of
the pancreas is confined with the hypoechoic stomach,
which provides a useful acoustic contrast (Figure 1B).
The pancreas is an elongated, mildly echogenic
structure lying between the stomach anteriorly and the
kidneys, aorta, and vertebral spine posteriorly. After the
image was frozen, the circumference was measured from
the left caudal edge (tail) usually located below the lateral edge of the stomach (depends on the stomach’s filling) to the right edge (head), located above the aorta
and spine. The circumference was measured by the freehand trace function (Figure 2). Each measurement was

repeated 2 or 3 times in each fetus, and the mean size
was considered for calculation. These data were also
used for evaluation of the intraobserver variability. The
first 90 cases were tested to assess the feasibility rate.
Statistical analyses were performed with the SPSS
version 20 statistical package for Windows (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY) and Excel 2013 software
(Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). All tests were
2 tailed, and P< 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
For estimation of a sufficient sample size, we used
the equation n 5 Z2 3 SD 3 (1 –SD)/E2
, where Z was
the Z score; SD, standard deviation; and E, margin of
error. We used a Z score of 1.645, which corresponds to
a confidence level of 95%, an SD of 0.5, and a margin of
error of 0.5% (0.005). These values yielded a sample
size of 270 cases.
The intraobserver and interobserver variability was
assessed by the interclass correlation coefficient. For
assessing agreement between the measurements, we
used a Bland-Altman plot. In light of the geographic distance between the centers, the interobserver variability
was assessed by evaluating the difference (unpaired Student t test) between the means per week of gestation for
each examiner.
The statistical analysis used to calculate the modeled
percentiles and standard deviations was based on the
method described previously.5–7 After assessment of the
normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test, fitted
means and SDs were calculated by regression models as

functions of gestational age (GA) for the raw data
(y 5 a 1 b 3 GA 1 b1 3 GA2 1 b2 3 GA3
). The r
2 statistic was used to assess the best quality of fit. After
aggregation of the raw data per week of gestation, the
means and standard deviations were calculated, and the
predicted values were estimated according to the bestfitted regression equation.
The modeled percentiles for a given gestational
age were calculates by the following equation:
percentileGA 5 mean
GA 1 K 3 SDGA, where K was the
corresponding percentile of the Gaussian distribution
(eg, determination of the 10th and 90th percentiles
requires K 5 61.28; determination of the 5th and 95th
percentiles requires K 5 61.645, etc), and the mean
and SD are the predicted values obtained from modeling
the original raw data for each week. The Z score (the difference between the measured and predicted pancreas
circumference divided by the predicted standard deviation) was calculated as well. To assess the correlation
between the pancreas circumference and fetal growth,
which is represented by the abdominal circumference
and estimated fetal weight, a 2-tailed bivariate Pearson
correlation test was used.
Results
Two hundred ninety-seven fetuses of nondiabetic mothers were selected for the study during a 3-year period.
They fulfilled our strict inclusion criteria for optimal
imaging of the pancreas, considered visualization of the
entire pancreas length from head to tail. In our pilot
study, we included fetuses between 12 and 38 weeks’ gestation. We realized that because of the morphologic characteristics of the pancreas, clear visualization of the head
was not yet reproducible by the abdominal approach in a
substantial number of cases before 19 weeks, and the visualization rate declined sharply after 36 weeks. Therefore,
for the sake of clinical applicability, we decided to limit
our study to the period between 19 and 36 weeks’ gestation. The learning curve is relatively long even for experienced specialists in the field of prenatal diagnosis. In our
experience, approximately 3 to 6 months of training was
necessary to achieve satisfactory skill in the setup of a
busy clinic and not in a consecutive manner. The overall
satisfactory visualization rate was 61.6% (55 of 90). It
decreased from 65.2% (47 of 72) before 30 weeks’ gestation to 44.4% (8 of 18) after 30 weeks’ gestation. The
main limiting factors was an unfavorable angle of
insonation, as in the fetal back-up position. Other limiting
factors were maternal obesity, bowel loops, and distal
shadowing of adjacent bony structures.
The intraobserver variability had a high interclass
correlation coefficient of 0.964 (95% confidence interval,
0.941–0.978; P< .001). The mean absolute difference
was 4.6 6 5.6 mm. The agreement between the measurements is presented in a Bland-Altman plot (Figure
3). The interobserver variability was assessed by comparing the mean pancreas circumference for each week
measured by both examiners. The mean absolute difference was 1.6 6 6.4 mm. The interclass correlation coefficient was high, at 0.967 (95% confidence interval,
0.92220.986), with a nonsignificant difference between
the measurements (P 5 .803).
The raw pancreas circumference (PC) data were
best correlated with gestational age by a cubic polynomial regression formula (PC 5 244.057524 1

and standard deviation for each week, they were fitted
according to a cubic polynomial regression formula
for the pancreas circumference (PC 5 47.561276 1

r

5 0.276; P 5 .025). Table 1 provides the measured
and predicted pancreas circumferences, 5th, 10th, 25th,
75th, 90th, and 95th percentiles, and standard deviations
by gestational age between 19 and 36 weeks. The mean
absolute Z score between measured and predicted values
was 0.2038 6 0.2644, which was very close to the theoretical values of 0 and 1 respectively.7
Figure 4 is a scatterplot of the measured values
superimposed on the modeled 5th to 95th percentiles,
showing a satisfactory goodness of fit for the model. The
same result is expressed in Figure 5, in which 90.7%
(264 of 291) of the Z scores for the fitted values, plotted
against gestational age, lie between 21.645 and 11.645
(5th–95th percentiles).
A good correlation was found between the raw pancreas circumference data and fetal abdominal circumference and estimated weight (Pearson r 5 0.829 and
0.812, respectively; P< .001). Cubic regression showed
the best fit for both (r

During the study period, 2 cases of intrauterine fetal
overgrowth were encountered. Both were referred
because of enlarged kidneys and abdominal circumference and estimated fetal weight above the 90th percentile for gestational age.8 No other major malformations
were detected. Fetal pancreas circumferences of 115 and
103 mm at 28 weeks’ gestation in both cases correlated
with 4.0 and 3.0 SDs above the mean for gestational age
(Figure 6). After multidisciplinary counseling including a
geneticist and pediatrician, both women elected to terminate the pregnancy. Postmortem pathologic examinations confirmed the presumed diagnosis of multiorgan
overgrowth syndrome. Weights above the normal range
were found in the heart, lungs, liver, spleen, thymus,
adrenal glands, kidneys, and brain. In most of the organs,
the histologic pattern was normal and appropriate for
gestational age. Other findings, such as macroglossia and
linear fissures in the lobule of the external ear, suggested
the diagnosis of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.
In the same period, a case of an isolated annular
pancreas was diagnosed prenatally. The woman was
referred at 34 weeks’ gestation with the findings of a
“double bubble” and severe polyhydramnios, which
caused premature contractions. First-trimester screening
results and anatomic sonographic findings were normal.
The karyotype was normal. A targeted examination of
the fetal pancreas revealed an abnormal shape of the
pancreas, wrapping the duodenum between the two
bubbles (Figure 7). At 37 weeks’ gestation, a spontaneous delivery occurred. A healthy female neonate weighting 1750 g was born, and 2 days later, a surgical
intervention was performed. At surgery, a complete circumferential annular pancreas was noted, causing
obstruction of the duodenum. No other congenital
anomalies of the internal organs were identified. A duodenojejunostomy was performed to bypass the
obstructed segment, with no postoperative complications. The child, who was 4 years old at the time of this
study, had no emerging clinical problems during her
medical follow-up.
Discussion
The fetal pancreas is not an easy organ to image even
when done by experienced sonographers and supported
by current high-quality technology. Three main objective factors contribute to the difficulty: As it is a parenchymatous organ, the echogenicity of the pancreas is
only mildly superior to that of the adjacent tissues, making clear delineation of its border challenging. In its retroperitoneal position, bowel loops tend to cover it more
and more as pregnancy advances. Moreover, a fetal
back-up position practically excludes its visualization
because of distal shadowing. All of these factors leave a
relatively narrow angle in the anteroposterior direction,
with the best axial resolution and contrast, which permits

obtainment of a satisfactory image of the pancreas from
head to tail.
Considering these facts, it is not surprising that the
improvement in our overall visualization rate lagged
behind the technological advancements since the last
studies (62% versus 49%1 and 52%2
).
Embryologic development of the fetal pancreas
begins in the fourth week of gestation with the formation of the dorsal and ventral buds as endodermal diverticula of the duodenum. At 6 weeks’ gestation, as a result
of duodenal rotation, the two buds fuse. The dorsal bud
forms the head, body, and tail of the pancreas, whereas
the ventral bud forms the hooklike uncinate process.
Four types of cells develop from the endoderm of the
pancreatic buds: 3 endocrine types (a-glucagon, binsulin, and d-somatostatin) and 1 exocrine type (digestive enzymes).9,10
In this study, we established, for the first time to our
knowledge, a normal reference range, which can be used
as a complementary tool when investigating fetal anomalies involving abnormal congenital development of the
fetal pancreas. We conducted an Online Mendelian
Inheritance in Man search, which was limited to the
word “pancreas” and to abstracts. We chose only cases
in which pancreatic disorders were consistent features
and excluded those in whom they were sporadically
mentioned in the description of the clinical features.
This search yielded 83 results. In online supplemental
Table S1, we listed what seemed to us the most relevant
for intrauterine life, excluding, for example, metabolic
etiologies and syndromes with “exocrine pancreatic
insufficiency,” in which the applicability to the prenatal
diagnosis was not clear. The pancreas can be congenitally completely or partially absent, as an isolated finding
with consequent congenital diabetes mellitus,3 or in
association with cerebellar absence or cardiac or renal
malformations. The pancreas can be hypoplastic or dysplastic, with fibrosis, cysts, or lipomatosis. An annular
pancreas can present as an isolated finding or can be
associated with some syndromes. Some of the overgrowth syndromes involve pancreatic hyperplasia of the
exocrine or endocrine part, which results in an increased
pancreas size. A recent publication focusing on the prenatal findings of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome highlights the sonographic visualization of a hyperplastic
pancreas as one of these findings, assuming, maybe, that
this organ is not usually demonstrable on sonography in
healthy fetuses.11
Moreover, pregnancy complications such as maternal diabetes mellitus and impaired placental perfusion,
which affect fetal growth, also affect pancreas growth,
with long-term consequence regarding development of
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or cardiovascular disease
(theory of Barker et al4,12).
Diabetic embryopathy-fetopathy is mainly related to
the degree and onset of maternal hyperglycemia.13
According to the Pedersen hypothesis,14 maternal hyperglycemia causes fetal hyperglycemia, which leads to hypertrophy of the b cells and resultant hyperinsulinemia.
Fetal pancreas growth is also influenced in cases
with decreased placental nutrient transport, as part of
global fetal growth restriction.15 Animal studies have
shown that maternal undernutrition causes elevations in
glucocorticoid concentrations, which, in turn, cause a
reduction in the b-cell mass in the fetus.16 This observation was not confirmed by a human pathologic study.17
On the other hand, case reports of human fetal pancreatic agenesis have demonstrated a clear association with
IUGR.18,19
In conclusion, pancreas development is correlated
with intrauterine fetal growth and the metabolic state, as
well as being a part of many genetic syndromes that
include abnormal pancreas development. Although challenging, and not applicable in a routine anatomic scan,
the ability to recognize its normal shape and dimension
is, in our opinion, an important skill to be obtained by
every fetal medicine unit in a tertiary center.
