ABSTRACT
Chemotherapy using single drug is not successful now a days due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant cancer cells. In the present work, Methotrexate (MTX) and Mitomycin C (MMC)
loaded hydrogel sensitive to both reduction and pH are prepared and well characterized using
various instrumentation techniques like FTIR, XRD, SEM and TEM. The drug loading and encapsulation efficiencies (DEE and DLE) of MTX are found to be 90.5 and 54.3% respectively and for MMC
the value is 95.1 and 62.7% respectively. Invitro cytotoxicity and Apoptosis studies confirm the
increased anticancer activity and selectivity of the novel carrier.

1. Introduction
Hydrogels are three-dimensional hydrophilic polymer networks that can imbibe large quantities of water without dissolving in it. Smart hydrogels consist of crosslinked
polymeric networks that can swell dramatically in response
to certain external stimuli, such as pH, temperature,
enzymes, light, electric and magnetic fields or the presence
of certain chemicals[1–6]
. But, most of the hydrogels are
mechanically weak due to isotropy in structure and due to
heterogeneity in the network structure. There comes the
necessity to develop hydrogels with high strength and good
properties. The crosslinking density of hydrogels can tune
the drug diffusion rate by adjusting the pore size[7] at the
same time, the chemical structure and nature of crosslinkers
can control the degradation rate of hydrogels[8] hydrogels
can be modified chemically or physically, to increase its
mechanical strength and biocompatibility. But the release of
drugs from the hydrogel network suffers various limitations.
The elastic property and macroscopic dimensions of them
make it difficult to carry and deliver the payloads at the
right time and place, smart hydrogels are exempted from
this. It is difficult to maintain the drug inside hydrogels, its
hydrophilic network releases the entrapped drug easily,
which leads to inefficient and nonselective therapy. When
we impart bulk modification to the hydrogel network to
overcome these limitations, undesired effects are observed
on hydrogel properties like biocompatibility, elastic modulus, etc., which makes its consumption fatal to the human
body. In order to overcome, these limitations many special
hydrogels have been prepared for example nanocomposite
hydrogel[9]
, slide ring hydrogel[10]
, double network hydrogels[11,12]
, tetra arm hydrogels[13]
. Among them, nanocomposite hydrogels (NCH) are more efficient because they have
the properties of two distinct drug delivery systems and also preserve the structural integrity and functionalities of the
incorporated nanoparticles, which offers unique properties
such as improved specificity, minimum burst release, targeted and controlled delivery of payloads from their network. Varieties of nanoparticles including metallic
nanoparticles[14] carbon-based nanomaterials[15]
, and polymeric nanoparticles[16] have been physically embedded
within the hydrogel network to create mechanically stable
and biocompatible hydrogels. NCH have been widely used
because of their unique physical, chemical and biological
properties[17,18]
. The graphene oxide (GO) and its derivatives are attracting great attention to develop nanocarriers
for biomedical applications, biological imaging and so on.
Due to one-atom thickness and two-dimensional plane, GO
can provide a large specific surface area for the immobilization of a large number of drugs[19] and the presence of
functional moieties such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, epoxy groups
which allow the attachment of targeting agents and drug
molecules, all these properties made GO a prominent material in biomedical field. The surface functionalization of graphene oxide sheets improves their dispersibility,
biocompatibility and selectivity it also reduces the aggregation of GO nanoparticles. The unique structure of graphene
oxide leads to its wide application in anti-cancer drugs
delivery[20–22]
. Also incorporation of chitosan was shown to
further improve the biocompatibility of GO and to limit the
cytotoxic effects on cells in in vitro tests[23]
. Although these
GO-based nanocarriers have excellent drug delivery properties the foremost problems has been retained: the biocompatible, stable dispersion in water, premature drug release
during blood circulation, and low extent of nanocarriers
dosage reaching the tumor tissues. To solve the drawbacks,
many attempts have been successfully carried out. Shi et al.
prepared a reduction responsive PEGylated GO nano sheets
(NGO-SS-mPEG)[24]
. It had high stability in biological solution and rapidly released the encapsulated DOX at tumor
micro environment. Most recently, it has been reported that
the PEGylated GO having di sulfide bonds will gradually
degrade in the presence of enzymes and glutathione
(GSH)[25]
. Gan et al. prepared the chitosan grafted graphene
oxide (GO  CS) having high aqueous solubility and biocompatibility, which can make stable nano complexes with
plasmid DNA[26]
. As compared with normal tissues, tumor
tissues usually possess the unique micro structural features
and physicochemical properties., such as weak acidity abnormal temperature, overexpressed receptors, proteins and
enzymes[27]
, and so on. Most importantly, the different
tumor intracellular microenvironments are expected to
adjust the anticancer drug release, via the response to pH
4.5  6.5 inside endosomes and lysosomes, reductive microenvironments due to high-level GSH, the most abundant
thiol containing peptide in animal cells, is very low (about
2.0  20.0 lM) in the cellular exterior, but much higher
(0.5  10.0 mM) in the cytoplasm, (2.0–10.0 mM) in the
cytoplasm and endo lysosomes of tumor cells[28–30]
. HA is a
well-known, natural polysaccharide that can be used as an
active tumor-targeting moiety due to its specific binding to
various CD44 (HA receptor) molecules that are
overexpresssed in cancer cells[31,32]
. In order to overcome
different drawbacks of mono drug chemotherapy such as
drug resistance, poorly controlled dosing, the combination
chemotherapy is more pronounced. Synergistic co-delivery
of multiple drugs with combined anticancer mechanism is
very much effective in killing cancer cells. Compared to the
delivery of single drug, delivering multiple drugs having different anticancer mechanism simultaneously to the same
tumor cells using single carrier can achieve high therapeutic
index and suppress the drug resistance[33]
. Amidst of these
encouraging benefits, the controlled, targeted and synchronous release of multiple drugs from a single carrier is still a
tedious task.
The emergence multi drug resistant tumor is now emerging as a real treat to mankind. The treatment of it by using
a single drug therapy is now becoming impossible. So, there
is an urge for combination chemotherapy. In order to
increase the efficiency of the therapy, the carrier must be
stimuli responsive. But the dual stimuli responsive behavior
of the carrier makes it more specific and the presence of a
targeting moiety adds color to the targeting efficiency of the
carrier. In the present work, we are searching for the solutions of the above mentioned problems of chemotherapy.
We prepared graphene oxide based pH/reduction responsive
carrier for the controlled and targeted delivery of two chemotherapeutic drugs Methotrexate and Mitomycin C. These
drugs have synergism in their activity. Simultaneous delivery
of two drug drugs in responsive to multiple stimuli is a tedious task. There are a large number of publications describing the targeted delivery of a single drug in response to
dual stimuli.
In the present work, we introduced Methotrexate (MTX)
and Mitomycin C (MMC) as the drugs for combination
chemotherapy. MTX and MMC are drugs with distinct
physicochemical characteristics and different anticancer
mechanisms. MTX, as an antimetabolite and antifolate drug,
could be delivered to the cytoplasm and reacted with dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) to inhibit the metabolism of
folic acid (FA), leading to a block in nucleic acid biosynthesis[34] .On the other hand, MMC, as a bio reductively
activated agent, which could be transported to nuclei and
reacts with DNA to inhibit DNA synthesis and nuclear division[35]
, higher dosing of it leads to nephrotoxicity[36]
. The
combination therapy of MTX and MMC is reported earlier[37]
. But dual stimuli responsive, HA conjugate carrier for
the delivery of MTX and MMC has not been reported yet.

studies 96-well ELISA plate reader or spectrophotometer capable of measuring the absorbance (ELX-800 Biotek), inverted
microscope (Biolink), 37 C incubator with humidified atmosphere of 5.0% CO2 (Healforce, China).
2.3. Preparation of dual drug loaded composite
hydrogel (DDLCHG)
2.3.1 Preparation of aminated graphene oxide (GO-NH2)
The GO was prepared from graphite using modified
Hummer’s method[38]
. The GO is aminated using EDA.
About 20.0 mg of GO was added to 20 mL of PBS (pH 7.0),
the mixture was sonicated for 1 h to give homogenous dispersion of nano GO sheets. The solution was then treated with
500 mM EDC and NHS and incubated for 30 min to activate
the carboxyl groups. Then add 0.2 mL of EDA and the mixture was incubated for another 2 h. The solution was allowed
to stand at 4.0 C overnight, and then centrifuged at 8000 rpm
for 10 min. The obtained precipitate was washed with deionized water and the final aminated GO were dried in vacuum.
2.3.2. Preparation of MTX-conjugated aminated GO (MTXGO-NH2)
To conjugate MTX to GO, first MTX is conjugated to glycine by applying the concept of amide bond linkage between
acid group of MTX and amine group of glycine (see supporting information). MTX-conjugated aminated GO nanosheets were prepared by dispersing 25.0 mg of nGO in
50.0 mL of buffer at pH 6.0. Then the activated MTX-gly
solution was added drop wise to the nGO dispersion with
constant stirring at 1000 rpm. After continuous stirring for
3 h at room temperature, glycine conjugated MTX was precipitated using absolute ethanol. Finally the product was
centrifuged at 6000 rpm, washed with water and ethanol,
dried and kept for further use.
2.3.3. Preparation of MTX and MMC-loaded composite
hydrogel (MMC þ MTX-GO@Gel-HA)/dual drugloaded composite hydrogel (DDLCHG)
For the synthesis of DDLCHG, MMC were loaded to the
surface of nGO sheets by p–p stacking interaction. About
15.0 mL of 5.0 and 10.0% solution of MTX- GO-NH2 was
mixed with 1.0 mL of aqueous MMC solution (30 mg/mL).
The solution was stirred continuously for 12 h at room temperature. Hyaluronic acid conjugated gelatin (Gel-HA) is
prepared by using EDC, NHS coupling by forming an amide
bond between the amine group of Gel and activated carboxyl group of HA. To the above solution, add 50.0 mL
(1.0 mg/mL) of activated Gel-HA solution (activated by
50.0 mg of EDC and 30.0 mg of NHS) followed by the addition of 20.0 mL (1.2 mg/mL) of cystamine solution drop
wise to form the DDLCHG (nGOHG-5% and nGOHG-10%
were prepared by coating of Gel-HA on nGO sheets having
no drugs). The schematic representation of DDLCHG is
shown in Scheme 1. The solution was kept stirring for 8 h at
room temperature. The final product was precipitated by
adding 50.0 mL of 0.1 M NaCl solution. The centrifugate is
kept for the determination loading efficiency.
2.4. Drug encapsulation efficiency (DEE) and drug
loading efficiency (DLE)
The amount of drugs in DDLCHG was determined by using
UV–Visible spectrometer at kmax of 304 nm and 364 nm for
MTX and MMC respectively. The centrifugate obtained after
the loading of two drugs as described in Section 2.3.3 were
subjected to analysis in UV–Visible spectrometer. DEE was
calculated based on the ratio of amount of drug present in the
carrier to the amount of drug used in the loading process[39]
.
The value of DLE and DEE were determined by the following Eqs. 1 and 2;
DLE ¼ ð Þ Total drug loaded  ðFree drugÞ
Total mass of components  100 (1)
DEE ¼ ð Þ Total drug  ðFree drugÞ
Total amount of drug  100 (2)

2.5. Swelling studies
The behavior of hydrogels in different solutions was analyzed using swelling studies. To identify the effect of pH on
selling of hydrogel, the swelling study is conducted in different pH conditions (2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 7.0, 9.0 and 10.0). A definite
amount of DDLCHG was transferred to a previously
weighed dialysis bag (12–14 KDa MWCO) and placed in
100.0 mL of medium of desired pH at room temperature for
48.0 h inorder to attain equilibrium. Only 0.1 M NaOH and
0.1 M HCl solutions were used to adjust the pH. The wet
dialysis bag containing DDLCHG (Ws) was weighed using
an electronic balance. It was then dried in an air oven at
60 C for 5 h until no change in the weight (Wd). Degree of
swelling was calculated as follows:
Degree of swelling ¼ ðWs  WdÞ=Wd (3)
where Ws is the weight of the swollen composite at a given
time during swelling and Wd is the weight of dry composites.
2.6. In vitro degradation studies
A series of samples having different compositions of nGO
were used for degradation studies. The degradation study
Scheme 1. Preparation of MMC þ MTX-GO@ Gel -HA.
4 T. S. ANIRUDHAN AND A. M. MANASA
was done in stimulated body fluid (SBF), using dialysis tubing cellulose membrane and determines the amount of mass
degraded in the medium. A definite amount of samples
were firstly fully swollen in SBF medium. The samples were
then placed in SBF containing 1.0 mg/mL of protease, an
enzyme that breaks peptide bonds, incubated at 37 C for
30 days. Sodium azide (NaN3) (0.1 wt %) was added to prevent growth of bacteria. The samples were recovered periodically, washed with distilled water, dried in vacuum
dessicator. The degree of degradation was calculated by
weight loss as,
Where W0 is dry weight of the samples before degradation, Wt is the weight of the samples at time t. The experiment is repeated in triplicate
2.7. In vitro drug release
The in vitro triggered release profiles of the MMC þ MTXGO@ Gel-HA under different conditions were evaluated by
a dialysis technique. Phosphate buffered solution (PBS) at
pH 7.4 or acetate buffered solution (ABS) at pH 5.0 with or
without 10 mM GSH and enzyme cathepsin B was used as
the environmental medium. In brief, 2 mg of DDLCHG was
added to dialysis bags (MWCO: 35000 Da) and placed in
100.0 mL of different media at 37.0 C under constant shaking. About 5.0 mL of the medium was removed in predefined intervals and replaced with fresh solution each time.
The amount of MTX and MMC released was measured
using a UV spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 304 and
364 nm. Then, the accumulative ratios of the released MTX
and MMC were calculated as a function of time. The measurements are repeated thrice for accuracy.
2.8. Cell culture
HeLa cells and L929 cells were purchased from The
National Center for Cell Science is a National Level,
Biotechnology, Tissue Engineering and Tissue Banking
research center (NCCS) Pune were maintained in
Dulbecco’s modified eagles media (Invitrogen, pH 7.4) supplemented with 10.0% FBS (Invitrogen) and grown to confluence at 37 C in 5.0% CO2 (NBS, EPPENDORF,
GERMANY) in a humidified atmosphere. Next step is to
seed 200.0 lL cell suspension in a 96-well plate at a cell
density of 20,000 cells per well, without the test agent.
The cells were trypsinized (500 ml of 0.025% Trypsin in PBS/
0.5 mM EDTA solution (Himedia)) for 2 min and passed to
T flasks in complete aseptic conditions. Allow the cells to
grow for about 12 h.
2.8.1. In vitro cytotoxicity studies
Add appropriate concentrations of the test agents which
were dissolved initially with DMSO and further dilutions
with culture medium (The higher concentration of test agent
must contain less than 5% of DMSO in its dilution). The
test samples were added to cells at a final concentration of
25, 50,100, 200 and 400 mg/ml from a stock of 1 mg/ml and
incubated for 24 h. Incubate the plate for 24 h at 37.0 C in a
5.0% CO2 atmosphere. After the incubation period, take out
the plates from incubator, and remove spent media and add
MTT reagent to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL of total
volume. Wrap the plate with aluminum foil to avoid exposure to light. Return the plates to the incubator and incubate
for 3 h. (Incubation time varies for different cell lines.
Within one experiment, incubation time should be kept
constant while making comparisons). Remove the MTT
reagent and then add 100 lL of solubilization solution
(DMSO). Gentle stirring in a gyratory shaker will enhance
dissolution. Occasionally, pipetting up and down may be
required to completely dissolve the MTT formazan crystals
especially in dense cultures. Read the absorbance on a spectrophotometer or an ELISA reader at 570 nm and 630 nm
used as reference wavelength. The Ic 50 value was determined by using linear regression equation i.e., Y ¼ Mx þ C.
Here, Y ¼ 50, M and C values were derived from the viability graph
2.8.2. Live/dead assay for the determination of apoptosis
The Acridine orange (AO) and ethidium bromide (EB) double staining is used here to determine the apoptosis of HeLa
and L929 cancer cell lines. After treatment with different
concentrations of sample (DDLCHG) such as 25.0, 50.0,
100.0, 200.0 and 400.0 mg/mL for 24 h, the cells were washed
by cold PBS and then stained with a mixture of AO
(100.0 lg/mL) and EB (100.0 lg/mL) at room temperature
for 10 min. The stained cells were washed twice with 1X
PBS and observed by a fluorescence microscope in blue filter
of fluorescent microscope (Olympus CKX41 with Optika
Pro5 camera).
The cells were divided into four categories as follows: living cells (normal green nucleus), early apoptotic (bright
green nucleus with condensed or fragmented chromatin),
late apoptotic (orange-stained nuclei with chromatin condensation or fragmentation) and necrotic cells (uniformly
orange-stained cell nuclei).
2.9. Statistical methods
Data were expressed as means of three separate experiments
and were compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA). A p
value <0.05 was considered statistically significant in
all cases.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Design and fabrication of DDLCHG
In this study a novel dual drug loaded and dual sensitive
GO based carrier is prepared. GO was first prepared according to the modified Hummers’ method by using natural
graphite flakes[40]
. To obtain nanosized GO (nGO), GO was
cracked using an ultrasonic probe at 570 W for 2 h. The
preparation of the carrier is shown in Scheme 1. The nGO
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLYMERIC MATERIALS AND POLYMERIC BIOMATERIALS 5
is aminated using ethylene diamine to form aminated GO
(GO-NH2) under the participation of EDC and NHS, the
amino acid glycine is used as a linker between the drug
MTX and GO-NH2, which is linked via amide linkage to
form MTX-GO-NH2, the second drug MMC is loaded on
the surface of nGO, by p–p stacking and hydrogen bonding
interactions. The remaining amino group in GO-NH2 is
linked to HA conjugate Gel which is then cross linked with
cystamine to form the MMC þ MTX-GO-NH2@ Gel-HA
nanocomposite hydrogel. The disulfide linkage makes the
carrier sensitive to reduction microenvironment of tumor
cells. The proposed carrier shows distinct advantages over
bare nGO nanoparticles and biodegradable natural polymers.
When compared with bare GO nanoparticles, polymer functionalized GO has high dispersibility and biocompatibility,
low agglomeration in the physiological condition, large
number of functionalities for conjugating drug and targeting
moieties, all these factors are highly beneficial in the biomedical field. Compared with polymer, the GO nanocomposite has high drug loading capacity, through physical
adsorption by p–p stacking and by the covalent conjugation
of MTX through amide linkage. Thus the novel dual drug
loaded multi stimuli responsive carrier could be a promising
agent in drug delivery field.
3.2. Characterization of NCH
Zeta potential measurements were carried out to determine
the surface charge and stability of the samples (Table 1).
The surface charge of GO is 42.5 ± 0.4 mV, this negative
charge is due to the presence of –COOH and –OH groups.
Amination of GO leads to an increase in charge; this is due
to the consumption of carboxyl group by EDA. But the
value is negative again; this may be due to the presence of
oxygen in epoxy and hydroxyl moieties. Which clearly indicate that amination occurred only in –COOH groups. After
the conjugation of MTX to GO-NH2 the charge again
increased, since MTX is a positive drug. The conjugation of
Gel-HA on MTX-GO-NH2 decreased the zeta potential
value, which may be due to the presence of more negative
–COOH group. The charge of dual drug loaded NCH is
raised than that of single drug loaded this may be due two
reasons: loading of another positive drug MMC and carboxyl groups has been used for crosslinking with cystamine.
The change in zeta potential value confirms the surface
modification. The size of nGO is found to be 237.0 nm from
DLS measurements.
The FTIR spectra of GO, GO-NH2, Gel-HA, MTX- GONH2, MTX-GO@ Gel-HA, MMC þ MTX-GO@ Gel-HA are
shown in Figure 1. The characteristic peaks of GO at
1730 cm1 (C¼O stretching), 1046 cm1 (O–H deformation
in carboxyl group), 1617 cm1 (C¼C stretching in aromatic
ring) is present. After amination of GO, the intensity of
peak at 1730 cm1 diminished considerably and a new peak
formed at 1537,1657 cm1
, due to the N–H bending vibration of an amide bond formed by the reaction of amine
group of EDA with –COOH group in GO. GO-NH2 has an
intense peak at 3415 cm1 due to the N–H stretching
vibration of primary amine which confirms the amination of
GO. Gel-HA has peaks at 3316 cm1 due to N–H and O–H
stretching, 1645 cm1 due to amide I (–C¼O stretching),
1575 cm1 due to amide II (N–H bending), 1314 cm1 due
to amide III of gelatin. The peak at 1408 due to O–H bending, 1303 cm1 due C–O stretching in HA[41]. The characteristic peaks of amide bond at 1575 cm1 and 1645 cm1
corresponding to the bending vibration of N–H and the
stretching vibration of C¼O respectively were observed. The
peak at 3316 cm1 is broadened due to O–H stretching of
Gel-HA. Peak in between 2078 cm1 is due to the –CH3
stretching vibration of HA. All this confirms the conjugation
of Gel-HA to GO-NH2 .The presence of characteristic peaks
of MTX at 3257, 1114, 1626, 1542 cm1 in MTX-GO-NH2
confirm the conjugation of MTX. The intensity of peaks at
3350 cm1 of MTX-GO-NH2 has diminished due to the conjugation of amine group with glycine –MTX. Infrared spectra of MTX-GO@ Gel-HA and MMC þ MTX-GO@ Gel-HA
are same, indicating that MMC is loaded on the surface of
nGO and the Gel-HA completely covers the nGO leading to
the submerging of MMC deep in the hydrogel matrix.
The XRD patterns of GO, GO-NH2, Gel-HA, MTX-GO@
Gel-HA, MMC þ MTX-GO@ Gel-HA is shown in Figure 2.
The characteristic diffraction peak of GO is at 11.6 with an
interlayer spacing of 7.4 Å. On amination the peaks become
less intense and broadened, which indicates the amorphous
nature. The basal spacing also increased, due to the presence
of amine group. The broadness of peaks may be due to the
Figure 1. FTIR spectra of GO, GO-NH2, Gel-HA, MTX- GO-NH2, MTX- GO@Gel
-HA, MMC þ MTX-GO@ Gel-HA.

poor stacking of GO-NH2.The conjugation of MTX to GONH2 imparts a small crystalline nature to the carrier and the
peaks shifts to lower angle, which indicated a decrease in d
spacing. This may be due to the entrapment of MTX.
There is no observable diffraction peak in MTX-GO@
Gel-HA and MMC þ MTX-GO@ Gel-HA, indicating that
GO has lost its ordered crystalline structure and GO is completely dispersed in the hydrogel matrix[42,43]
.
The morphology of different samples was analyzed using
SEM (Figure 3). The SEM image of GO has sheet like
morphology with crinkles, the sheets appeared to be stacked
and there are many wrinkles on the surfaces as reported earlier[44,45]
. The severe agglomeration of GO sample may be
due to its enormous oxygen functionalities on the surface.
Amination of GO leads to a small morphological change,
the surface become more rough, the lamellar structure is
preserved during amination which indicates the preservation
of basic structure of GO. Gelatin has smooth granular surface morphology. On conjugating MTX to GO, the surface
became smooth. But when Gel is conjugated to GO-NH2,
the surface became flaky. The loading of the second drug
and the crosslinking with cystamine gave the carrier a flower
like morphology. These morphological changes are visible
evidence for the fact that all modifications were effective
and suitable for the synthesis of the novel drug carrier. The
TEM image of nGO sheets is shown in Figure 4. From the
Figure 4, we can see the thin wrinkled sheets of GO, which
confirm the well exfoliated structure of GO sheets without
agglomeration (Table 1).
To quantify the composition of the carrier and for predicting the thermal stability of samples, thermogravimetric
analysis was performed. The TGA curves of different samples in the present work are shown in Figure 5. It has been

reported that the TGA analysis of raw materials such as Gel,
MTX, HA etc exhibit 100.0% weight loss at 900.0 C[46–48]
.
From figure we can understand that all samples show 5.0%
weight loss at temperature up to 100 C, this indicates the
release of moisture in the samples. GO began to deplete
after 105 C and showed 22.0% weight loss at 210 C. This
may be due to the decomposition of labile oxygen containing groups such as carboxyl, epoxy, hydroxyl etc[49]
. For GO
about 32.0% of its initial weight remains at temperature
900 C. GO-NH2 has 44.0% weight loss at 370 C, this is due
to the thermal decomposition of chemically conjugated
–NH2 group and partially due to the pyrolysis of carbon
skeleton. When MTX is conjugated to GO-NH2, the weight
loss between 370 C increased up to 27.0%, this may be due
to the decomposition of functional groups in MTX. Upon
introducing Gel–HA, the weight loss of about 50% occurred
at 430 C. This indicates the pyrolysis of additional functional groups in Gel-HA. At 900 C GO, GO-NH2, MTXGO-NH2, MTX-GO@ Gel-HA has a remnant mass of 32.0,
20.8, 16.0 and 11.8% respectively. From these values, the
weight content of the grafted components can be determined as follows, the amount of EDA unit in GO-NH2 is
calculated to be 35.0%, MTX and EDA units in MTX-GONH2 is 23.1 and 26.9% respectively (Table S1). The amount
of MTX and Gel-HA in MTX-GO@ Gel-HA is found to be
15.8 and 49.9% respectively (Figure 5).
3.3. Drug encapsulation efficiency (DEE) and drugloading efficiency (DLE)
The drug-loading efficiency (DLE) and drug encapsulation
efficiency (DEE) are calculated from Eqs 1 and 2. MTX is
chemically conjugated to nGO by amide linkage between the
amine group in GO-NH2 and –COOH group in MTX.
Hence in case of MTX, DEE and DLE increases with
increase in amination and amount of drug loaded. The loading content increases with increase in amount of drug
loaded, reaches a maximum value there after remains constant. This may be due to the saturation of the functional
sites of carrier with MTX. Thus the optimum amount of
MTX is 45.0 mg/g of carrier. Thus the DEE and DLE of
MTX are found to be 90.5 and 54.3% respectively. As many
anticancer drugs, MMC is aromatic and hydrophobic. The
large p-conjugated structure of GO can form p  p stacking
interaction with these aromatic drugs molecules and two
planes of GO can interact with these aromatic compounds,
which makes GO a new platform for MMC delivery. Thus,
the second drug MMC has DEE and DLE is 95.1 and 62.7%
respectively, this high value is due to the p–p stacking interaction and hydrogen bonding interaction of MMC with
GO[50]
. In the case of MMC the load capacity (weight ratio
of loaded MMC to nGO) was estimated to be 11.2 wt % via
the standard absorption of MMC at 374 nm. The increase in
amination leads to an increase in the loading of MTX,
whereas an increase in GO concentration leads to an
increase in loading for both MTX and MMC.
3.4. In vitro swelling studies
In order to investigate the effect of pH on swelling of hydrogel, we studied the swelling behavior at pH 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 7.0,
8.0 and 10.0. As shown in Figure 6, the swelling behavior of
all hydrogels increased with increasing pH from 2.0 to 7.0.
However, it was decreased at pHs higher than 7.0.
Increasing the pH from 2.0 to 7.0, the carboxylic groups of
Gel were converted into negatively charged carboxylate ions,
which results in the repulsion of similar charges and water
would be taken up[51]
. While increasing the pH beyond 7.0,
we observed a decrease in swelling. It might be due to the
shielding of negatively charged carboxylate ion with high

concentration of sodium ions, thus preventing the anion–
anion repulsion and upsets the extending of the molecular
chains of the hydrogel[52]
. Moreover, compared to pure Gel
hydrogel, the nanocomposite hydrogel showed higher swelling ability. The improvement of the swelling behavior of
GO nanocomposite hydrogels could be attributed to the
presence of GO nanoparticles of different sizes, morphologies and surface charges. The GO nanoparticles result in the
penetration of more water molecules to balance the ionic
osmotic pressure created in the hydrogel matrix, which
causes the hydrogel to swell[53]
. The effect of the GO quantity on swelling of nanocomposite hydrogel was investigated
by varying the amount of GO (5%, 10%). As shown in
Figure 6 with increasing the GO amount, the swelling capacity was increased. This may be due to the complex interaction between GO, water molecules and Gel. Theoretically,
the hydrophilic groups of GO sheets can simultaneously
form various H-bonding with water molecules, acid groups
in Gel and hydrophilic groups of other GO sheets. At low
loading, GO sheets largely interact with water molecules
through H-bonding. But as the loading of GO increased,
more water molecules were kept in the composite hydrogels,
leading to an increase in the swelling ratio. Furthermore, the
intercalation of GO nanoparticles in hydrogel networks may
cause to increase the pore size and space inside the hydrogel, as a consequence more water could be absorbed[54,55]
.
Swelling has no contribution to the drug release. Even
though the hydrogels has high swelling at higher pH values
the drug release is low at high pHs. This is because the
higher pH solution cannot detach the drug from the carrier.
3.5. In vitro degradation studies
In order to predict the physiological stability of the carrier,
the degradation studies of the carrier are conducted and the
results are shown in Figure 7. The effect of graphene oxide
content on the degradation rate of carrier has been determined by changing the composition GO, 5.0 wt% of nGO
(nGOHG-5%), 10.0 wt% nGO (nGOHG-10%) and
DDLCHG. These samples were immersed in simulated body
fluid (SBF) containing protease. The amount of mass
dropped in different intervals of time is measured. The
hydrogel containing 1.0% GO degrades faster than nGOHG10%. The nGOHG-5% lost 48.0% of their initial mass after
one week as compared to 25.0 wt% for nGOHG-10% and
32.0 wt% for DDLCHG. The degradation rate is high at initial stage for all samples. This is a result of the enzyme
action on gelatin chains containing different amino acids.
Once the number of suitable sites has been attacked by the
enzyme, the degradation rate slows down. After one week,
the degradation rate is in a controlled manner, only slight
amount of mass degrades for nGOHG-10% and DDLCHG.
The degradation rate for all samples plateaus around third
week, after which the mass of samples varies not more than
3.0%. The difference in mass loss of samples is due different
weight percentage of GO. The GO nanoparticles are impermeable to most molecules[56,57] This leads to a decrease in
the permeation rate of enzymes through a nanocomposite[58]
. The chain movement of chitosan on MTX-GO@
Gel-HA is restricted due to strong hydrogen bonding and di
sulfide bonds[59]
. The difference in mass loss between
nGOHG-5,10% and DDLCHG can be attributed to the presence of the drugs in the latter which limited the bonding
sites between GO and Gel-HA.
3.6. In vitro drug release studies and kinetics
The Figures 8A and 8B shows the release of MTX and
MMC at different conditions. In order to optimize the conditions of drug release, we conducted the experiment in varied conditions. The effect of pH and presence of enzyme on
MTX release is shown in Figure 8A. We investigated the
release in two pH conditions to mimic the physiological
(pH: 7.4) and tumor (pH: 5.0) conditions and in presence or
absence of enzyme. It can be observed from figure, that
there is a burst release of MTX in the initial stage, followed
by a controlled release in the second stage of drug release.
Figure 7. Degradation profile of samples (n ¼ 3 and data are presented
as mean ± S.D).
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLYMERIC MATERIALS AND POLYMERIC BIOMATERIALS 9
The release is maximum in low pH and in the presence
of enzyme which was completed in 120 h with the final
release percentage being over 98.0%. In the presence of protease, cathepsin B (a commercially available proteolytic
enzyme, an important lysosomal cysteine protease over
expressed in various malignant for the fast protein degradation during cell division and regulate cancer pathology)[60,61]
, MTX has a fast release about 60.0% in the first
24 h (a combination of spontaneous hydrolysis and enzymatic hydrolysis). As a comparison, only 29.2% was released
in the absence of enzyme and only 15.8% released in pH 7.4
(hydrolysis was the reason for the drug release). In short,
when the DDLCHG is internalized into the tumor cells by
using the targeting moiety, the presence of different types of
proteases in acidic intracellular endo/lysosomes that can
break the peptide bond between MTX and nGO act a leading role in the release of active form of MTX from
the carrier.
The release of MMC in different pH conditions are
shown in Figure 8B, to compare the effect of reduction
environment, we evaluated the release from nGO which is
not coated with Gel-HA. The release of MMC is high at pH
5.0 from the nGO having no Gel-HA. Strong hydrogen
bonding between the drug and nGO under high pH condition than that under low pH resulted in fast release rate. But
the coating of Gel-HA, leads to a very low release even at
low pH, due to the presence of stable disulfide bonds. Thus
we optimized the release conditions as low pH and presence
of enzyme (for MTX) and low pH (for MMC). Hence, we
used the pH 5.0 for further reduction responsive release of
the drugs as shown in Figure 8C. The release of both drugs
is favored by the presence of GSH. In the presence of GSH
the di sulfide bond breaks and leads to the release of drugs.
The release maximum of MMC reached 98.3 and 25.8%,
respectively in the presence and absence of GSH. The release
of MTX is triggered by the presence of both enzyme and
GSH. But the presence of Gel-HA blocks the enzyme from
its target. But the GSH reduces the disulfide bond and
makes the site of action (amide bond between GO and
MTX) accessible for enzymes. Due to this dual stimuli
Drug release (%)

responsive behavior of MMC þ MTX-GO@ Gel-HA, the
chemotherapeutic agents loaded on it remains stable at
physiological pH, thus prolonging the circulation time of
drugs and thus minimize the premature release of drugs.
Once the MMC þ MTX-GO@ Gel-HA is engulfed by the
tumor mediated by the targeting moiety (HA), controlled
release of the payloads occurs. The drug release is triggered
by the dissociation of the carrier in the tumor micro environment (low pH, presence of cathepsin B and
10.0 mM GSH).
To investigate the release kinetics and mechanism of
drug release from MMC þ MTX-GO@ Gel-HA, the release
profiles were fitted to various mathematical models and the
results are shown in Table 2. From the table, one can conclude that, for the release of MTX the best fit model kinetic
model is first order kinetics fR2 value close to 1g. However
the release of MMC is best fitted to Higuchi model fR2
value close to 1g, indicates that the drug release follows a
square root of time and also matrix degradation assist the
drug release.
The release mechanism determined using
Korsmeyer–Peppas fit Mt/M1¼ KPt
n
Where Mt/M1 is the fractional drug release into dissolution medium and KP is a constant incorporating the structural and geometric characteristics of the matrix.
The term ‘n’ is the diffusional constant that characterizes
the drug release transport mechanism. According to peppas
theory, drug release follows different mechanism depending
on the value of n. if n  0.43 (Fickian diffusion),
0.43 < n < 0.85 (Non Fickian (anomalous) diffusion),
n > 0.85 (Case III transport or super case III transport)[62]
.
For the release of MTX and MMC in the absence of GSH, n
value is less than 0.43 indicating Fickian diffusion, where as
in the presence of GSH, n value is in between 0.43 and 0.85,
which corresponds to anomalous non-Fickian diffusion
mechanism with combined effect of diffusion and erosion.
This change in release mechanism may be a result of the
cleavage of di sulfide bond in the presence of GSH. This
loses the coating of Gel–HA and makes the drugs more
exposed to the tumor micro environment. The k values of
MTX and MMC obtained in pH 5.0 with 10 mM GSH is
many times higher compared with that in the absence of
GSH, suggesting the higher release rate in the reduction
environment of tumor cells.
3.7 Invitro cytotoxicity studies
A large number of receptor binding molecules are widely
reported, while HA is extensively used as a major ligand due
to biocompatible, biodegradable, and nontoxic behavior, and
a natural polysaccharide present in the extracellular matrix
and synovial fluids. It has been extensively investigated for
tumor-targeted drug delivery, due to biodegradability, biocompatibility, non-immunogenicity, nontoxicity, and due to
the presence of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups for functionalization[63]
. CD44 receptors, which serves as a HA receptor
and is overexpresssed on the cell surfaces of many malignant
tumors, was expected to mediate uptake of MMC þ MTXGO@ Gel-HA into cancer cells to achieve tumor targeting
and enhance treatment efficacy[64,65]
. In order to investigate
the targeting effect of MMC þ MTX-GO@ Gel-HA, we
investigated the cellular uptake studies on two types of cell
lines, CD44þ (over expressed CD44 receptor) HeLa cell lines
and CD44- (under expressed CD44 receptor) L929 cell lines.
The cell viability of HeLa cells at different concentrations
of physical mixture of drugs, MTX-GO@ Gel -HA and
MMC þ MTX-GO@ Gel-HA during is shown in Figure S1.
By analyzing the graph, the cell viability of the physical mixture of drugs decreases rapidly with concentration. But the
cell viability is lower for drugs loaded in the carrier. For
MMC þ MTX-GO@ Gel-HA the cell viability is lower than
MTX-GO@ Gel-HA this indicates the synergistic activity of
both drugs in killing tumor cells. In order to evaluate the
targeting efficiency of DDLCHG, the cell viability study is
conducted for HeLa and L929. The results obtained are
shown in Figure 9. The cell viability of HeLa cell lines is
lower than that of L929 for same concentration of sample.
Even at very high concentration of DDLCHG, the cell viability for L929 is greater than 45.0% whereas for HeLa cell

lines, the value is less than 15.0%. These observations clearly
indicate the prominent role of the targeting moiety (HA) in
destroying cancer cells (HeLa cells are CD44þ where as
L929 cells are CD44-
). The targeting efficiency of HA selectively kills cancer cells and dual stimuli responsive behavior
of the carrier leads to efficient and controlled delivery of
MTX and MMC to cancer cells and their synergistic mechanism effectively kill the tumor cells. Figure 10 shows the
microscopic images of HeLa and L929 cell lines during
MTT assay, which is a visual evidence for above facts.

3.8. Live/dead assay for the determination of apoptosis
In order to determine the invitro apoptosis of cell lines live/
dead assay is conducted on HeLa and L929 cell lines and
the results are shown in Figures 11 and 12. The green fluorescence is an indication of healthy viable cells as these cells
intercalate the green fluorescent dye acrydine orange. The
orange cells display apoptotic death by intercalating the red
fluorescent dye ethidium bromide. The results showed a
dose dependent cell death in both the cell lines. Being
CD44þ the HeLa cells require lower concentration for eliciting the cell death as the CD44 receptor can effectively direct
the drug loaded nanoparticles inside the cells. The images of
L929 cell lines with different concentrations show that,
400.0 mg/mL concentration of DDLCHG can lead to a very
small amount of cell death. The high rate of cell death in
the presence of CD44 receptor reveals the selective tumor
targeting efficiency of HA. This targeting nature lowers the
harm to normal
4. Conclusions
In summary, we developed nGO based versatile and robust
dual stimuli responsive composite hydrogel for cancer cell
specific delivery of MTX and MMC. The DDLCHG release
both drugs with distinct functions and different antitumor
mechanisms for synergistic chemotherapy. HA acts as the
targeting moiety which helps in the CD44 receptor mediated
endocytosis of DDLCHG. Thermal stability of sample is
confirmed by TGA analysis. Particle size, SEM and TEM
confirmed the nanometric size of the GO sheets. In vitro
drug release study confirms the dual stimuli responsive
behavior of hydrogel. In vitro cytotoxicity and Apoptosis
studies confirm the increased anticancer activity and selectivity of DDLCHG as compared to the physical mixture of
two drugs. The tumor cell specific delivery nature of our
novel DDLCHG reduces the side effects due to repeated
dosing. In short, we suggest that novel MMC þ MTX-GO@
Gel-HA is a potential dual drug carrier for targeted and
combination chemotherapy.
