The development of hollow ferrogadolinium nanonetworks has not been reported for nanomedicine
application until now. In this study, we developed a hollow and porous ferrogadolinium nanonetwork
structure using the one-pot solvothermal method. This nanoparticle could be simultaneously used as
a T1 and T2 dual-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent. In addition, the hollow lumen
and abundant pores of the nanonetworks maximized the loading capacity and conferred the
nanoplatforms for suitable anticancer drug loading capacity. Using these nanonetworks, MRI and
anticancer experiments were conducted in vitro and satisfactory dual-modal MRI and cancer
chemotherapy results were obtained. Therefore, the nanonetworks with dual-modal MRI and drug
loading abilities effectively complement the ferrogadolinium composites' library and hold great promise
in nanomedicine for simultaneous cancer diagnosis and chemotherapy.
1. Introduction
Currently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most
powerful non-invasive imaging modalities used in the diagnosis
of different cancers.1–3 However, more than half of the diseased
patients require the use of an MRI contrast agent (CA) to
enhance the contrast of the targeted site within the surrounding
tissues and improve the resolution of the MRI images.4,5 There
are two types of CAs commonly used: Gd-based compounds are
oen employed as T1 CAs and Fe-based magnetic nanomaterials
are oen utilized as T2 CAs.6–9 However, the inherent limitations
of single mode CAs are oen criticized, thus rendering dualmodal MRI CAs as more acceptable because the synergistic
combination of T1-and T2-weighted MRI can provide more
comprehensive imaging information, increase the diagnostic
accuracy, and improve the overall prognosis of patients.10,11
In the study of dual-modal MRI CAs, most attention has been
paid to ferrogadolinium nanocomposites because Gd- and Febased compounds are commonly used as T1 and T2 CAs,
respectively.12,13 It is worth noting that as T1 CAs are directly in
contact with the magnetic core and located within the magnetic
eld generated by the magnetic core and opposite to the
external magnetic eld, T2 CAs can severely perturb T1
imaging.6,7,14 Hence, T1 CAs should be on the inside or away
from the outside of the magnetic core. However, many previous
studies have failed to observe this.15–17 Many interesting nanostructures of ferrogadolinium composites have been reported to
reduce the interference of T2 CAs for T1 imaging, including yolklike structures, barbell-like structures, and others.6,18 However,
their synthesis process is multi-step and very complicated.
Furthermore, many of these nanostructures are limited in their
ability to load drugs because of their non-porous surface
structures.6,7,15–23
Up until now, a hollow and porous ferrogadolinium nanonetwork (HPFN) has not been reported. In this case, Gd3+ is
located inside the HPFN and has a parallel spin ordering with
the same direction as the magnetic eld induced by the Febased material, which will not disturb the T1 imaging, thus
providing effective T1 imaging.7,10,24 Moreover, the porous and
hollow structure is benecial for the water molecules contacting
T1 and T2 CAs as well as for efficient drug loading.
In this study, we developed a HPFN using the one-pot solvothermal method. This nanoparticle simultaneously and efficiently exerted T1 and T2 contrast ability. In addition, the hollow
lumen and abundant mesopores conferred the nanonetworks
a high specic surface area, which was critical for the abundant
loading of anticancer drugs. Cisplatin, a commonly used anticancer drug,25,26 was selected as the model drug and loaded into
the nanonetworks. Using these nanonetworks, MRI and

anticancer experiments were conducted in vitro and satisfactory
dual-modal MRI and cancer chemotherapy results were obtained. Therefore, the easily synthesized nanonetworks with
dual-modal MRI and drug loading abilities effectively complement the ferrogadolinium nanocomposites' library and holds
great promise in nanomedicine for simultaneous cancer diagnosis and chemotherapy.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Chemicals
All obtained chemicals were of analytical grade and used
without further purication. Fe(acac)3, Gd(acac)3, 1,6-hexanediamine, CH3COONa, cisplatin, ethylene glycol, and uorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) were purchased from Aladdin Co.
(Shanghai, China). All other chemicals were provided by the
Sinopharm Co. (Shanghai, China).
2.2. Preparation of amine-functionalized HPFN
Fe(acac)3 (0.5 g), and Gd(acac)3 (0.5 g) were added into ethylene
glycol (30 mL) and vigorously stirred at 80 C for 1 h. Then, 1,6-
hexanediamine (3.6 g) was added into the solution and stirred
at 80 C for an additional 0.5 h. CH3COONa (4 g) was then added
into the solution and reacted for 0.5 h. The mixture was sealed
in a Teon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 200 C
for 24 h. The resulting product was precipitated by centrifugation, briey rinsed with water and ethanol three times to
effectively remove the solvent and excess 1,6-hexanediamine,
and then dried at 60 C before characterization and application.
2.3. Loading cisplatin into HPFN
HPFN (30 mg) were dispersed into 10 mL of cisplatin solution
(2 mg mL1
) under stirring overnight. Cisplatin-loaded HPFN
nanonetworks (designated as HPFNC) were centrifuged and the
supernatant was detected by inductively coupled plasma optical
emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) to quantify the unloaded
cisplatin. The loading capacity of cisplatin could be calculated
using the equation LC (%) ¼ [2 mg mL1  c(cisplatin)sup]  V/
mnanoplatform  100%. In the in vitro experiments, the HPFN and
HPFNC were re-suspended in distilled water and ltered using
a 0.8 mm-membrane lter.
2.4. Observing the cellular uptake of HPFN in vitro
Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to dene
the intracellular localization of uorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)-labeled HPFN (designated as HPFN-FITC) in HeLa cells.
To form HPFN-FITC conjugates, FITC was loaded into the
HPFN. HeLa cells seeded in 60 mm-polystyrene plates (5  105
cells per dish) were treated with HPFN-FITC (24 mg mL1
) for
1 h, 3 h, and 6 h, and then stained with NucRed Live 647
ReadyProbes Reagent (Invitrogen, USA) for 15 min at 37 C in
the dark. The cells were washed twice with PBS (pH 7.4) and
xed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. The cells were then

visualized using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope with 100/63
oil-immersion objective lens.
2.5. Measuring MRI in vitro
The longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) relaxation time of
HPFN was detected using a 9.4 T MRI scanner. The T1 and T2
relaxation rates were measured using the inversion recovery
method and a multi-echo spin echo sequence, respectively. The
imaging parameters were as follows: TR ¼ 6000 ms; TE ¼ 5.6
ms; slice thickness ¼ 1.0 mm; matrix ¼ 96  96. Relaxivity (r1
and r2) was determined using a linear t of the relaxation time
as a function of the amount of Gd or Fe ions determined by ICPOES.
2.6. Cytotoxicity assays
HeLa cells at a density of 5  104 cells per m2 were incubated in
a humidied incubator at 37 C for 24 h. The adherent HeLa
cells were then treated with different concentrations of cisplatin
and HPFNC in the growth medium at 37 C in 96-well plates for
24 h and 48 h. Following this, MTT (5 mg mL1
, 10 mL) was
added to each well and incubated for an additional 4 h. The
supernatant was removed, and 100 mL of DMSO was added to
completely dissolve the formazan crystals by vigorously shaking
the cell culture plate for 10 min until no particulate matter was
visible. The absorbance in each well was measured at 570 nm
using a microplate reader (Biotek, USA). The biocompatibility of
the HPFN was also tested by following the above process, except
that cisplatin was replaced with HPFN.
2.7. Characterization
The general morphology and microstructure of the sample were
observed under a scanning electron microscope (SEM; Hitachi,
Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and a H-800 transmission electron microscope (TEM; Hitachi, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The nitrogen
adsorption–desorption isotherm of the sample was measured
using a porosimetry analyzer (Tristar II, 3020M, Micromeritics,
USA). The structure and interaction of the sample was characterized using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD) (TTR-III, Rigaku
Co., Japan) and an X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS)
(Thermo ESCALAB 250XI, USA), respectively. The composition
of the sample was determined using a Thermo Nicolet iS10
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer (Thermo Electron, Co., USA), and the spectral data were processed using the
soware of the spectrometer (OMNIC). The magnetic behavior
of the sample was measured by a superconducting quantum
interference device magnetometer (Bruker Co., Germany).
3. Results and discussion

nanonetworks, and it had a parallel spin ordering with the same
direction as the magnetic eld induced by the Fe-based material. At this point, the Fe-based material did not disturb Gd3+;
instead, it further enhanced the T1 imaging. In addition, the
porous and hollow structure with a large specic surface area
was benecial for the water molecules contacting T1 and T2 CAs
as well as for sufficient loading of the drugs. In this case, HPFN
could be used for simultaneous cancer diagnosis and
chemotherapy.
As shown in Fig. 1a and b, the TEM micrographs display that
the HPFN adopted a hollow and porous nanonetwork architecture with homogeneous dispersion. It is well known that
good dispersibility of the nanoparticles is important for the
nanomedical applications. The nanonetworks could be well
dispersed both in water and PBS, and the hydrodynamic size
analysis of the HPFN also showed that the nanonetworks
possessed homogeneous size distribution. These results were
consistent with the observation from TEM images. XRD peaks
appearing in the HPFN display broad and low-intensity peaks,
which are likely to be indexed to spinel Fe3O4 (JCPDS no. 19-
0629) and low-crystallinity Gd2O3 (JCPDS no. 12-0797) (Fig. 1c),
conrming that the nanomaterial was composed of ferrogadolinium oxide. As previously reported, many modiers with
active groups such as amino or carboxylate groups could control
the formation of nanomaterials and improve the colloidal
stability and biocompatibility of the prepared nanomaterials
during the reaction processes.27 The mechanism could be
attributed to the fact that these charged groups can coordinate
with metal cations in solution and affect the nucleation and
mass transfer process of the nanocrystals, thus resulting in the
formation of controllable nanostructures. Similarly, in our case,
two –NH2 groups exist in the head and tail of each 1,6-hexanediamine molecule with ve C–C bonds in the middle. As
shown in Fig. S1,† during the solvothermal process, in the rst
1 h, Fe(acac)3 and Gd(acac)3 were continuously degraded to
release iron and gadolinium cations, which could easily be
coordinated by 1,6-hexanediamine, probably forming large
molecular networks by the linking of positively charged iron
and gadolinium cation-coordinated 1,6-hexanediamine molecules.27 At the same time, the iron and gadolinium cations in
the formed large molecular networks are slowly hydrated to
form Fe(OH)3 and Gd(OH)3, and reduced by ethylene glycol to
form Fe3O4 or undergo pyrolysis to form Gd2O3 at high
temperature and pressure condition.28 During this process, the
formed amorphous solid spheres grow continuously and start
crystallizing at the surface of the spheres because the surface is
in full contact with the solution.29 Compared with the large and
well-crystallized particles on the exteriors of the spheres, the
inner amorphous crystallites have higher surface energy, which
provides the driving force for the Ostwald ripening. Therefore,
the inner crystallites tend to dissolve, resulting in interior void
space and porous structure.29

Subsequently, the specic surface area and porosity of HPFN
were analyzed using nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm
curves (Fig. 1d). The data showed that the HPFN had a high
specic surface area (175.3 m2 g1
) and a uniform pore size
distribution (predominantly 4.6 nm). The isotherm curve showed
that the typical hysteresis behavior at 0.5–0.8 P/P0 was attributed
to the delay in nitrogen evaporation from the hollow-space of
lumen, which was blocked by the surrounding mesopores. This
nding demonstrated that HPFN is an ideal drug carrier.
XPS analysis of the samples (Fig. 2a) conrmed the presence of
Fe, Gd, O, C, and N elements, indicating the existence of ferrogadolinium oxide and 1,6-hexanediamine in this nanocomposite.
Aer loading cisplatin, a new peak at 73.3 eV (Pt 4f) appeared,
indicating that cisplatin was successfully loaded into HPFN to
form HPFNC. Moreover, the N 1s peak shied from 399 eV (Fig. 2b)
to 400.4 eV (Fig. 2c), conrming that cisplatin was loaded into
HPFN through coordination between cisplatin and the NH2 group
of HPFN. The drug loading amount was calculated as 7.9%.

Subsequently, the composition of HPFN was conrmed using the
FT-IR spectrum (Fig. 2d). The peaks at 519 cm1
, 588 cm1
,
1512 cm1
, and 1080 cm1 were respectively assigned to Gd–O
stretching vibration, Fe–O stretching vibration, N–H bending
vibration, and C–N stretching vibration (Fig. 2d), conrming the
existence of Gd2O3, Fe3O4, and 1,6-hexanediamine in HPFN.
Field-dependent magnetization curves showed that the saturated magnetization value of HPFN was 9.6 emu g1 at 300 K
(Fig. 3a). In addition, the magnetization of HPFN continuously
increased along with the increase in the applied magnetic eld at
3 K, which may have been due to the enhanced spin canting
effect of Gd3+ in HPFN.30,31 In addition, the hysteresis at 3 K
indicated that the nanonetworks possessed superparamagnetism. Standard zero-eld cooling (ZFC) and eld
cooling (FC) measurements of HPFN displayed similar curves
compared to those of paramagnetic Gd2O3 at a low temperature,
but gradually became similar to the curves of superparamagentic
Fe3O4 with an increase in temperature (Fig. 3b). These magnetic
properties of HPFN were similar to those previously reported for
ferrogadolinium oxide composites,6 indicating that the nanonetwork was composed of ferrogadolinium oxide composite.
3.2. Observation of uptake by HeLa cells
For the CLSM experiment, aer the HeLa cells were incubated
with HPFN-FITC for different times, the uorescence of the cells
displayed a time-dependent enhancement (Fig. 4). In the initial
1 h, weak green uorescence was observed within the cytomembrane, indicating that only a few HPFN-FITC particles were
localized within the cytomembrane of the HeLa cells. With the
increase in incubation time, the uorescence within the cytomembrane gradually increased, and weak uorescence was also
found in the cytoplasm. Aer 6 h of incubation, strong uorescence distributed uniformly within the cells, suggesting that
increasing number of HPFN-FITC particles crossed the cell
membrane and entered the cytoplasm. These results conrmed
that the HPFN could be effectively internalized by the HeLa
cells, and can enhance the localized dose in HeLa cells.
3.3. T1–T2 dual-modal MRI Performance
As shown in Fig. 5, with the increase in concentrations of HPFN,
T1-and T2-weighted MR images gradually brightened and
darkened, respectively, indicating that the HPFN had a dosedependent MRI contrast ability. The r1 value of the HPFN was
6.63 s1 mM1
, which was calculated as the ratio of the proton
relaxation (1/T1) to the Gd3+ ion concentration. The r2 value of
HPFN was 244.07 s1 mM1
, which was calculated as the ratio
of the 1/T2 to the Fe3+ ion concentration. These values were
higher than the r1 and r2 values of the commercially available
Gd or Fe-based contrast agents.32,33 On one hand, the high r1
and r2 values may be attributed to the porous and hollow
structure of HPFN, which was benecial for the water freely
contacting Gd3+ ions or being close to Fe3O4 and thus, good T1
and T2 imaging was obtained. On the other hand, the Fe-based
material inside the HPFN would not disturb the Gd3+ ions.
3.4. Investigation of biocompatibility and antitumor effect
of the nanosystem
The release behavior of the drugs from HPFNC under different
pH conditions was explored before it was used for the antitumor
experiment (Fig. S2†). The result indicated that the cisplatin
release was pH-dependent. Cisplatin had low drug release rate
at pH 7.4. However, the drug release rate could be promoted
under acidic condition. This was because the coordination

effect between –NH2 and cisplatin could be easily destroyed
under acidic conditions.28 We know that good biocompatibility
of nanomaterials is important for biomedical applications. As
shown in Fig. 6, no signicant decrease in the viability of the
HeLa cells was observed aer they were incubated with
increasing HPFN concentrations for 48 h, indicating that HPFN
had good biocompatibility. Following this, the viability of the
HeLa cells incubated with free cisplatin and HPFNC was
assessed. We found that cellular apoptosis induced by free
cisplatin and HPFNC was strictly proportional to the dose of the
anticancer drug (Fig. 7). Clearly, HPFNC displayed higher
cancer cell inhibition than free cisplatin. This was because
HPFN enhanced the localized drug dose in the HeLa cells. In
addition, compared with 24 h of co-cultivation, 48 h of cocultivation of the HeLa cells with either free cisplatin or
HPFNC resulted in enhanced cellular apoptosis, indicating that
the cellular apoptosis induced by free cisplatin and HPFNC was
proportional to the co-cultivation time. This was because
cisplatin needed enough time to affect DNA transcription. It is
worth noting that at a high drug dose (>10.24 mg mL1
) aer
48 h of co-cultivation, free cisplatin displayed a slightly higher
cancer cell inhibition than HPFNC. This might be attributed to
the fact that at a high-dose of HPFNC and a longer co-cultivation
time, too many HPFNC particles were taken up by the cells,
which inhibited the cells' uptake of more HPFNC. This was also
conrmed when only a slight decrease in the viability of the
HeLa cells was obtained on further increasing the dose of
HPFNC.
4. Conclusions
In this study, we successfully developed a hollow and porous
ferrogadolinium oxide nanonetwork (HPFN) using a simple
solvothermal method. This nanoparticle with high T1 and T2
relaxivity (r1 ¼ 6.63 s1 mM1
, r2 ¼ 244.07 s1 mM1
) could be
simultaneously used as T1 and T2 dual-modal MRI CA. The
model anticancer drug cisplatin was efficiently loaded into
HPFN with a large specic surface area (175.3 m2 g1
), and the
loading amount of cisplatin was up to 7.9%. The HPFN displayed satisfactory dual-modal MRI contrast ability. In the in
vitro experiments, the HPFNC can efficiently kill cancer cells in
a dose/time-dependent manner. Therefore, HPFN with dualmodal MRI and drug loading ability could be used as a potential nanomedicine for simultaneous cancer diagnosis and
chemotherapy.
