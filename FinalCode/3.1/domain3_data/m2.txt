Since TGF-β is a critical factor in the fibrotic process, downregulation of this cytokine has been considered a potential approach for disease treatment. Herein, we designed a new lung-targeted delivery technology based on the complexation of polymeric antisense oligonucleotides (pASO) and dimeric human β-defensin 23 (DhBD23). Antisense oligonucleotides targeting TGF-β mRNA were polymerized by rolling circle amplification and complexed with DhBD23. After complexation with DhBD23, pASO showed improved serum stability and enhanced uptake by fibroblasts in vitro and lung-specific accumulation upon intravenous injection in vivo. The pASO/DhBD23 complex delivered into the lung downregulated target mRNA, and subsequently alleviated lung fibrosis in mice, as demonstrated by western blotting, quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence imaging. Moreover, as the complex was prepared only with highly biocompatible materials such as DNA and human-derived peptides, no systemic toxicity was observed in major organs. Therefore, the pASO/ DhBD23 complex is a promising gene therapy platform with lung-targeting ability to treat various pulmonary diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis, with low side effects. 1. Introduction Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic disease based on the excessive production of interstitial collagen and extracellular matrix, caused by overexpressed inflammatory activity on environmentally or chemically damaged lung tissue [1,2]. Abnormal accumulation of fibrotic tissue narrows the airway and thickens the epithelium in the alveoli, leading to severe breathing problems, with reduced oxygen supply in the blood [3,4]. In spite of the increasing global incidence of pulmonary fibrosis [5], current interventions for the disease are very limited [6,7], signifying the urgency for new therapeutic approaches [8]. During the progression of fibrosis, many growth factors are up-regulated [9]. In particular, TGF-β plays a central role in the fibro-proliferative process in general, suggesting that it and its downstream genes can be potential targets for the treatment of the disease [10–12]. Oligonucleotide-based gene regulators, such as antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting mRNA, are promising molecules to treat diseases refractory to treatment with traditional small molecule drugs. These can be simply designed based on the target sequence, without consideration of complex protein structures, and provide the knock-down of targets [13]. The therapeutic efficacy and safety profile of these agents have been validated by regulation agencies, and recently translated to clinical settings [14,15]. Previously, ASOs and siRNAs targeting TGF-β and the relevant downstream factors have been utilized as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of fibrosis in other organs, such as heart, kidney, and intestine [16–19]. In the same context, we envisioned that lung fibrosis could be managed through the downregulation of TGF-β, using https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2020.03.016 Received 12 November 2019; Received in revised form 9 March 2020; Accepted 12 March 2020 ⁎ Corresponding author. ⁎⁎ Corresponding author at: Center for Theragnosis, Biomedical Research Institute, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), Hwarangno 14-gil 5, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul 02792, Republic of Korea.

However, as TGF-β plays active roles at other sites [20], lung-specific delivery of the oligonucleotides is necessary to prevent the potential side effects from the undesired suppression of the target in other tissues. Although lung delivery via local routes can considerably avoid drug distribution to other tissues, several drawbacks need to be addressed. Intratracheal injection is an invasive approach and is not highly acceptable in practical applications. Intranasal administration, using nose breathers demonstrated in a mouse model, is hard to be translated into clinical practice owing to irregular lung distribution, limited deposition near superior airways, and differences in lung anatomy between human and mouse [21–23]. While non-invasive inhalation is a widely used method for lung delivery, pulmonary surfactants, such as mucus and alveolar fluid, severely reduce cellular penetration and transfection of the oligonucleotides [24]. Many lung diseases including fibrosis occur in the lower region of the lung, which is hardly accessible by improperly sized formulations [25]. These drawbacks of local delivery methods could be addressed by employing a systemic delivery route, such as intravenous injection, since the lower region of the lung is directly accessible through capillary blood vessels surrounding the alveoli, circumventing the interference of pulmonary surfactants. However, systemic delivery of oligonucleotide therapeutics into the fibrotic region of the lung is very challenging, as it requires a delivery platform that can achieve multiple goals, including protection of oligonucleotides against nuclease, lung-specific distribution of the oligonucleotides, and intracellular delivery of the distributed oligonucleotides into the fibrotic cells. In this study, we utilized a human-derived cationic peptide as a carrier for the systemic lung-specific delivery of an ASO targeting TGF-β mRNA, for the effective treatment of lung fibrosis. In order to increase the loading of ASO and provide better complexation with the peptide, polymeric ASO (pASO), prepared by rolling circle amplification (RCA), was used as the gene regulator (Fig. 1). The polyanionic pASO has the potential to be complexed with positively charged residues of the cationic peptide, to form self-assembled nanoparticles by charge-charge interaction. We considered a dimeric human β-defensin peptide (DhBD) as the cationic peptide to be complexed with pASO since DhBD has multiple positive residues that can efficiently complex with various nucleic acid cargos and deliver the cargos into cells [26]. Among the various human β-defensins (DhBDs), we used DhBD23 for complexation with pASO, since the monomer (hBD23) is composed of a relatively short sequence that can be chemically synthesized [27]. Upon intravenous injection, the opsonization of the pASO/DhBD23 complex increased the particle size suitable for lung accumulation. Complexation of pASO with the peptide not only protected pASO from nuclease degradation, but further enhanced its cellular uptake after arrival at the lung tissue. The successfully delivered pASO effectively downregulated the target, leading to suppressed lung fibrosis in animal models. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials Rolling circle amplification (RCA) primer and linear template oligonucleotides were synthesized by Bioneer (Daejeon, Korea). T4 ligase and exonucleases (I and III) were purchased by New England BioLabs (MA, USA). Phi29 polymerase and reaction buffer were obtained by Lucigen (WI, USA). Human β-defensin peptide was synthesized by Peptron (Daejeon, Korea). Cyanine 5–6-propargylamino-2′-deoxyuridine-5′-triphosphate (Cy5-dUTP) and bleomycin were acquired from Trilink (CA, USA) and Cayman (MI, USA), respectively. Other chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (MO, USA). 2.2. Cell culture MLg cells (mouse lung fibroblast cell line) and bEnd.3 cells (mouse brain endothelial cell line) were maintained in DMEM media (Welgene, Gyeongsan, Korea) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Welgene, Gyeongsan, Korea), 100 IU/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. 2.3. Circularization of linear template Linear template oligonucleotides were circularized by T4 ligase reaction. 15 μM pASO primer, 10 μM template DNA, T4 ligase and ligation buffer were mixed and incubated at 16 °C for overnight. Uncircularized oligonucleotides were removed by enzymatic reaction at 37 °C for 2 h using exonuclease I and III. The circularized template was separated on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and purified using an ethanol precipitation method. The purified circular template was quantified by measuring UV absorbance at 260 nm and identified by 8% denaturing PAGE at 100 V for 80 min. 2.4. Preparation of pASO RCA reaction was performed using phi29 polymerase reaction. 50 nM RCA primer, 50 nM circular template, 0.2 mM dNTP, phi29 polymerase and phi29 polymerase buffer were mixed and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by heating at 65 °C for 10 min. Unreacted precursors were removed by dialysis at room temperature for 24 h using a 100 kDa Amicon membrane filter (Merck Millipore, MA, USA). Purified pASO was quantified by measuring UV absorbance at 260 nm. 2.5. Dimerization of hBD23 To prepare a dimeric form of hBD23 (DhBD23), cysteine residue of hBD23 was dimerized using oxidation reaction. Following the previously reported method [28], 50 μM hBD23, 5 mM cysteine, 500 μM cystine, 2 mM EDTA, 1 M guanidine chloride and 0.1 M ammonium acetate were mixed at 4 °C for overnight. By centrifugation at 1500 ×g for 1 h using a 3 kDa Amicon membrane filter, the reaction mixture was purified and the buffer was exchanged to distilled water. Purified DhBD23 was quantified by measuring UV absorbance at 280 nm and verified on 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) at 200 V for 40 min followed by Coomassie blue staining. 2.6. Complexation of pASO with DhBD23 Various N/P ratios between pASO and DhBD23 (the number of the ammonium group in DhBD23 / the number of the phosphate group in pASO) were explored to determine the ratio that all the pASO was fully complexed with DhBD23. The pASO/DhBD23 complex with different ratios (N/P ratio = 0.5:1, 1:1, 3:1, 6:1 and 9:1) was mixed and incubated at room temperature for 1 h under shaking. Complexation between pASO and DhBD23 was confirmed by 0.5% agarose gel electrophoresis at 120 V for 40 min using SYBR gold staining. 2.7. Characterization of pASO and pASO/DhBD23 complex Diameter and surface charge of the pASO/DhBD23 complex (N/P ratio = 3) were measured using a Zetasizer (Malvern Instruments, Worcestershire, UK). For protein binding study, various concentrations of BSA (1, 5 and 10 mg/mL) were incubated with pASO and pASO/ DhBD23 complex for 1 h at 37 °C. Shear stress from vigorous pipetting was applied to the pASO/DhBD23 in the presence of 10 mg/mL BSA and the change of size was monitored with the Zetasizer. For observing the morphology and size of pASO and pASO/DhBD23 with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), they were dried on silicon wafers and coated with Au. Nova Nano SEM 200 (FEI, OR, USA) was used to J. Kim, et al. Journal of Controlled Release 322 (2020) 108–121 109 acquire high resolution images of samples at an accelerating voltage of 3 kV. 2.8. Serum stability To test serum stability, 50% mouse serum was added to pASO and pASO/DhBD23 (2 μM) and the mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for pre-determined time points (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4. 8, 12 and 24 h). At the end of each time point, 80 μg of proteinase K, 50 μM EDTA, 0.1% SDS were added to the solution and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in order to degrade serum proteins and observe fragmented pattern [29]. The samples were analyzed on 2% agarose gel electrophoresis at 120 V for 1 h using SYBR gold staining. The results were visualized using an iBright™ FL1000 (Invitrogen, CA, USA) and the band intensity was quantified with Image J software 1.45 (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). 2.9. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) 200 nM of formulations (PBS, scrambled sequence of pASO (ScrpASO), DhBD23, Scr-pASO/DhBD23, pASO, and pASO/DhBD23) in serum-free media were treated to MLg cells for 24 h at 37 °C to examine the efficacy of the pASO/DhBD23 complex. Then, total RNA was isolated from the sample using TRIzol® reagent (Qiazen, CA, USA). RNA purity and concentration were measured with a Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). RNA was reverse transcribed using a ReverTra Ace® qPCR RT Kit (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan) following the manufacturer's protocol. The mRNA expression was assessed by realtime PCR using SensiFAST sybr Hi-Rox Mix (Bioline USA Inc., MA, USA) with CFX96 Touch™ Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, CA, USA). The 2-ΔΔCt method was used to analyze the relative changes in gene expression based on real-time quantitative PCR. GAPDH was used as an internal control gene. Primer sequences for qRT-PCR were as follows; TGF-β (Forward) CGA AGC GGA CTA CTA TGC TAA AGA G; (Reverse) TGG TTT TCT CAT AGA TGG CGT TG and GAPDH (Forward) TGC ACC ACC AAC TGC TTA G; (Reverse) GGA TGA GGG ATG ATG TTC. 2.10. Cell uptake study pASO was fluorescently labeled by exchanging 5% of dTTP with Cy5-dUTP when RCA reaction was performed. MLg and bEnd.3 cells (1 × 105 ) were treated with 200 nM Cy5-labeled pASO and pASO/ DhBD23 complexes in serum-free media and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. After washing two times with ice-cold PBS, fluorescence intensity of the cells was measured using a flow cytometer (Guava, Millipore, MA, USA). 10,000 events were recorded for each sample and experiments were triplicated. To investigate the endocytosis mechanism in endothelial cells, endocytosis inhibitors (10 μM chloropromazine (CPZ), 1 mM methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), and 50 μM ethylisopropyl amiloride (EIPA)) in serum-free media were pre-incubated with bEnd.3 cells prior to the pASO/DhBD23 complex treatment. Flow cytometry Fig. 1. Schematic illustration for preparation of the pASO/DhBD23 complex and delivery of the complex to the lung to treat pulmonary fibrosis by downregulation of TGF-β. J. Kim, et al. Journal of Controlled Release 322 (2020) 108–121 110 analysis of the samples was performed as described above. For visualization of fluorescence signal, MLg and bEnd.3 cells (1 × 105 ) treated with Cy5-labeled pASO and pASO/DhBD23 were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. After washing two times with PBS, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde solution for 30 min and the nucleus was stained with 4′, 6- diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). To observe the intracellular location of the pASO/DhBD23 complex, FITC-labeled LysoTracker (L7526, Invitrogen) was additionally treated to MLg cells for 1 h at 37 °C prior to the fixation step. Fluorescence signals of DAPI, FITC and Cy5 were visualized using a confocal laser scanning microscopy (LSM700, Cal Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) at the magnitude of ×400. 2.11. Bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) (2018–082). The protocol of animal experiments was accorded with the KIST guidelines and regulations. To prepare the pulmonary fibrosis (PF) animal model, nine-week old male C57BL6 mice (Orient Bio, Seongnam, Korea) were intratracheally injected with 50 μL of 3 mg/mL bleomycin by following the previously reported procedure [30]. 2.12. In vivo, ex vivo and frozen-sectioned fluorescence imaging At 24 h post-injection of bleomycin, the PF mice or healthy mice in each group were intravenously administered with PBS, Cy5-pASO and Cy5-pASO/DhBD23, respectively (2 nmol of pASO/mouse). In vivo fluorescence imaging was performed at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 24 h postinjection using an IVIS imaging system (PerkinElmer, MA, USA). For ex vivo fluorescence imaging, the PF mice or healthy mice in each group (n = 3) intravenously injected with each sample (2 nmol of pASO/ mouse) were sacrificed at 7 h post-injection. Fluorescence intensities in liver, lung, spleen, kidney, and heart were measured using an IVIS imaging system. Each organ embedded in optimum cutting temperature (OCT) compound (Sakura Finetek Inc., CA, USA) was frozen at −80 °C for frozen-sectioned fluorescence imaging. Frozen tissues were sectioned using a cryostat with thickness of 10 μm. The nucleus in the tissue section was stained with DAPI mounting solutions (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Fluorescence signals in the tissue sections were visualized using a confocal laser scanning microscopy (LSM 700) at the magnitude of ×200. 2.13. Sample preparation for in vivo efficacy and toxicity studies At 24 h post-injection of bleomycin, PF mice in each group (n = 3) were intravenously injected with PBS, pASO, and pASO/DhBD23 for 3- times with a 3-day interval. After 2-days post-injection, major organs were harvested for evaluating in vivo efficacy and toxicity. For a control study, organs from healthy mice were also collected for western blot, qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence imaging, and toxicity study. 2.14. Western blot For immunoblotting, tissues were homogenized and lysed with RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS and 1% sodium deoxycholate supplemented with 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM DTT), 1 mM NaF, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany). After centrifugation at 16,000 ×g for 30 min, the supernatant was collected for western blot. Protein was quantified by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The samples were heated for 5 min and an equal amount of protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12%) using standard conditions. Anti- TGF-β antibody (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-130348, TX, USA) and anti-GAPDH antibody (1:1000); Abcam, ab9484) were treated in 5% skim milk at 4 °C for overnight. HRP activity was measured using enhanced chemiluminescence (EzWestLumi, Tokyo, Japan). Protein band intensity was visualized on ChemiDoc (Bio-Rad) and quantified using Image J software 1.45 (National Institutes of Health). 2.15. qRT-PCR with tissue samples With tissue samples, the relative mRNA level of target gene (TGF-β) as well as non-target genes (IL-1β, IL-6, HIF-1α, TBP and HPRT1) were quantified using qRT-PCR as descried in the Section 2.9. Primer sequences for qRT-PCR were as follows; TGF-β (Forward) CAC TCC CGT GGC TTC TAG TG; (Reverse) GCG GGT GAC CTC TTT AGC AT and GAPDH (Forward) ACT GTG GTC ATG AGC CCT TC; (Reverse) GGG TGT GAA CCA CGA GAA AT (primer sequences of non-target genes were shown in Table S2). 2.16. Tissue histology, immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining Harvested tissues were fixed in 10% (v/v) neutral buffered formalin before preparation of paraffin sections. Paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E; Sigma-Aldrich), or using a Masson's trichrome stain kit (Sigma-Aldrich) to detect collagen. Before immunohistochemistry, deparaffinized sections were boiled in 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 20 min and incubated with 0.3% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 15 min. Sections were blocked in normal goat serum at 37 °C for 1 h and immunostained for overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against TGFβ (1:200; Abcam, ab92486). Slides were visualized using avidin-biotin peroxidase complex (ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, CA, USA) and 3, 3′- diaminobenzidine tetrachloride (DAB; Zymed Laboratories, CA, USA) and counterstained with hematoxylin. Slides were measured using a light microscopy (Cal Zeiss) and quantified using Image J software 1.45 (National Institutes of Health). For lung tissue immunofluorescence imaging, deparaffinized slides were co-immunostained with TGF-β (1:200, Abcam, #ab92486 or Santa Cruz Biotechnology, #sc-130348), α-SMA (1:200, Sigma-Aldrich, A5228), pro-SPC, CD31, and F4/80 (1:200, Abcam, #ab90716, #ab28364, #ab100790, respectively) overnight at 4 °C. Nucleus was counterstained with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich), and stained tissues were imaged using a microscopy ECLIPSE Ts2R (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Sections were prepared from various parts of each lung, generating 10 regions of analysis per lung. Results were obtained from at least 3 individuals blinded to the identity of the sections. Quantification of positive staining was analyzed with ImageJ software using standard algorithms to define the areas of staining (ImageJ, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). 2.17. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism. Comparisons of all results were performed by one- or two-way ANOVA and Newman-Keuls test where indicated. The difference was considered statistically significant at P ≤ 0.05, P ≤ 0.01 and P ≤ 0.001. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Preparation and characterization of the pASO/DhBD complex The circular template for the RCA reaction was designed to include two copies of ASO in the sequence and prepared as previously described (Fig. 1, Fig. S1a, and Table S1) [31,32]. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the RCA reaction on the circular template yielded pASO as the high-molecularweight product, demonstrated using agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2a) and DhBD23 was prepared by oxidizing cysteine residues in hBD23 peptide (Fig. S1b). The size of pASO estimated as 504 nm by J. Kim, et al. Journal of Controlled Release 322 (2020) 108–121 111 dynamic light scattering (DLS) was slightly increased to 541 nm after complexation with DhBD23 (Fig. 2b). The sizes estimated by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were approximately 560 nm for pASO and 600 nm for pASO/DhBD23, which were comparable to those determined by DLS (Fig. 2d, e). The complexation led to the morphological change from a distinctive flower-like shape of pASO to a particle shape with less concave faces of the complex in the SEM images. The negative zeta potential value of pASO (−12.0 mV) changed to +27.8 mV through the complexation with cationic DhBD23 (Fig. 2c). As these therapeutic agents are susceptible to endonucleases and exonucleases in serum [33], most can be degraded before reaching the target site [34] in an in vivo experiment. Accordingly, it is necessary to examine whether the serum stability of pASO is suitable for in vivo applications. In the 50% mouse serum solution, 90% of pASO was degraded within an hour, whereas only 5% of pASO in the complex with DhBD23 was degraded (Fig. 2f, g, and h). The pASO/DhBD23 complex maintained 70% of its integrity even after 24 h. The significantly improved serum stability of pASO in the complex indicated that DhBD23 could protect the polynucleotide against serum nucleases. Fig. 2. Characterization of pASO and pASO/DhBD23.

Journal of Controlled Release 322 (2020) 108–121 112 3.2. In vitro activity of the pASO/DhBD23 complex Following the preparation and characterization of the pASO/ DhBD23 complex, we investigated in vitro activity of the complex. After the mouse lung fibroblasts (MLg) were treated with the complex, the level of TGF-β mRNA was estimated by quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). The target gene level was 31% decreased by treatment of pASO and 52% by treatment of pASO/DhBD23, respectively (Fig. 3). Treatment with DhBD23 did not significantly affected to the target gene level. Moreover, the downregulation activity by pASO/ DhBD23 appeared to be specific for the target sequence as treatment with pASO composed of scrambled sequences such as Scr-pASO and ScrpASO/DhBD23 failed to induce the downregulation activity at the target gene (Fig. 3). 3.3. Biodistribution of the pASO/DhBD23 complex Having observed in vitro target gene-specific downregulation by the pASO/DhBD23 complex, we investigated in vivo activity of the complex. At first, we examined biodistribution with a bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis mouse model, presenting a fibrotic histologic pattern and fibrosis-relevant biological factors in the lung (e.g., increased production of collagen and upregulation of TGF-β) [35]. For in vivo imaging, pASO prepared with Cy5-labeled dUTP was complexed with DhBD23 and intravenously administered into the mouse model. Upon intravenous injection, pASO/DhBD23 rapidly distributed in the lung, and then slowly cleared with time (Fig. 4a). Even after 24 h, a considerable amount of pASO/DhBD23 remained in the lung. In contrast, despite the similar initial lung distribution level, pASO was almost cleared from the lung after 24 h (Fig. S2). When ex vivo imaging was performed with the harvested major organs at 7 h post-injection, only pASO/DhBD23 showed distinguishably lung-specific accumulation (Fig. 4b). To quantitatively estimate the lung specificity of pASO/DhBD23, the averaged fluorescence intensity of each organ was measured (Fig. 4c and Fig. S3). The intensity of pASO/DhBD23 in the lung was approximately 10-fold higher than that in the liver, the organ showing the second-highest accumulation level, which clearly indicated the high lung specificity of pASO/DhBD23. Additionally, the lung-specific accumulation was confirmed in the tissue section images obtained from pASO/DhBD23- treated mice (Fig. 4d). Quantitative analysis of different cell types in the section images revealed that uptake of pASO/DhBD23 complex was much higher than that of pASO in all the cell types examined (Fig. S4). It is well-known that lung accumulation can be achieved using micrometer-sized particles captured in the pulmonary capillary [36–38]. When the hydrodynamic size was measured by DLS in the presence of albumin, the most abundant protein in serum, the size of the pASO/DhBD23 complex increased to approximately 1 μm owing to binding with the serum protein. This suggested that the complex size was suitably increased for lung accumulation by adsorption of serum proteins after intravenous injection (Fig. S5). Similarly, the size of pASO increased with the addition of albumin, which may contribute to the initial lung accumulation of the naked polynucleotide. However, despite enhancing transient lung accumulation, the size effect alone was insufficient to maintain a sustainably high lung distribution level. While the lung-targeting ability of the complex was not limited to the lung fibrosis model, as similar biodistribution was observed in healthy mice (Fig. S6), the accumulation level in healthy mice was lower than that in fibrosis mice. Once the complex particles are located in the lung capillary based on the size effect, the shear stress by blood flow can fragment the microparticles formed with nucleic acids and peptides into smaller nanoparticles which can be uptaken into endothelial cells by endocytosis [39]. Some of endocytosed nanoparticles will reach interstitium via transcellular delivery. This is the size-dependent mechanism commonly shared in both healthy and fibrosis mice. In addition, fibrosis can cause damage on endothelium resulting in enhanced permeability of nanoparticles from capillary to interstitium where fibrotic cells are located according to previous studies [40,41], which explains the higher lung accumulation level of the complex in fibrosis mice compared with healthy mice. 3.4. Cellular uptake property of the pASO/DhBD23 complex Subsequent to the delivery of ASO to the lung, intracellular delivery of the therapeutic cargo is another significant challenge, as hydrophilic and negatively charged ASO cannot easily cross the cellular membrane owing to its physicochemical properties [42]. In order to achieve sufficient therapeutic benefits, the complex needs to penetrate the endothelial cells of the capillary to reach the fibrotic cells for high accumulation in the lung fibrotic tissue. Thus, we studied the cellular uptake property of pASO/DhBD23 in a model endothelial cell line (bEnd.3). The flow cytometric analysis of the cells treated with pASO/DhBD23 demonstrated significantly enhanced cellular uptake than pASO (Fig. 5a). The endothelial cell uptake of pASO/DhBD23 was mediated by cavelolae-dependent endocytosis (Fig. S7). Caveolae is abundantly expressed in lung endothelia and regulates transport of materials across the endothelial layer [43], which suggests that the complex could possibly penetrate the lung endothelium via the cavelolae-dependent mechanism. In addition, compared to naked pASO, pASO/DhBD23 was more efficiently delivered to the model lung fibroblast cells (MLg), illustrating that the complex facilitated the delivery of pASO to the target fibrotic cells after penetration of the endothelial cell barrier of the capillary (Fig. 5b). Similarly, the high cellular uptake efficiency of pASO/DhBD23 complex in both endothelial cells and fibroblasts was also observed in fluorescence microscopic images, whereas the uptake level of naked pASO were relatively lower (Fig. 5c and d). The intense red aggregates in cell images (Fig. 5c and d) appear to be the complex particles concentrated in endosomes/lysosomes during endocytosis, as their locations are superimposed with the lysosomes visualized with LysoTracker (Fig. 5e). The complex particles could be diffused after cytosolic release. These results suggest that the high lung accumulation of pASO/ DhBD23 is due to the efficient penetration of the endothelial barrier and enhanced intracellular uptake into lung fibrotic cells after arriving Fig. 3.

In vivo downregulation of TGF-β by the pASO/DhBD23 complex After observing the lung-specific delivery of pASO/DhBD23, we next evaluated whether the delivered pASO downregulated the target gene. Bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis mice (n = 3) were intravenously administered PBS, pASO, or pASO/DhBD23 (Fig. 6a). After 48 h, the lung was excised and lysed, and the lysate solution was analyzed to estimate the in vivo efficacy of the antisense oligonucleotide. In qRT-PCR, the upregulated mRNA level of TGF-β in fibrosis was not substantially affected by pASO treatment (Fig. 6b). However, pASO/DhBD23 treatment evidently reduced the mRNA level (Fig. 6b), indicating that pASO/DhBD23 could successfully knock-down TGF-β mRNA in the animal disease model. We additionally performed qRTPCR for analysis of several fibrosis-related non-target mRNAs (IL-1β, IL6, and HIF-1α) and mRNAs of common housekeeping proteins (TBP and HPRT1) in lung tissue. As shown in Fig. S8, the levels of these nontarget genes were not affected by the treatment of pASO/DhBD23, indicating that the activity of pASO/DhBD23 was target-specific. Consistent with the qRT-PCR results, the western blot analysis showed significantly reduced expression level of TGF-β in pASO/ DhBD23-treated groups, compared with PBS- and pASO-treated groups (Fig. 6c and e). The decreased protein level of TGF-β was also clearly observed on the tissue section when immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of TGF-β was conducted (Fig. 6d and f). We further explored the treatment potency by visualizing the antifibrotic changes in the lung tissue. When mice were treated with the pASO/DhBD23 complex, immunofluorescence imaging displayed markedly decreased level of TGF-β in the endothelial cells and fibroblasts of the lung (Fig. S9a and S9b). Quantitative analysis of each cell type expressing TGF-β indicated that TGF-β expression was decreased by 50% in endothelial cells and 60% in fibrotic cells, respectively, by treatment of pASO/DhBD23 (Fig. 7a and b) although higher TGF-β expression was induced by fibrosis in fibroblasts than in endothelial cells. These results corresponded with the in vitro study that demonstrated the uptake of the complex in both endothelial cells and fibroblasts. In contrast, despite the considerable in vitro cellular uptake level of pASO itself, the target protein level in the endothelium and fibrotic tissue of the pASO-treated group were not significantly decreased (~ 10%), compared to the PBS-treated groups (Fig. 7a, b, S9a, and S9b). This illustrates that the complexation with DhBD23 is critical for pASO to show the desired potency in vivo. On expanding the image analysis to other areas of the lung tissue, such as epithelial cells and macrophages, we observed the same pattern of images; only pASO/DhBD23 could knock-down the target among other treatments (Fig. S9c and S9d). In quantitative analysis of each cell type expressing TGF-β, TGF-β expression was decreased by 55% in epithelial cells and 93% in macrophages, respectively, by treatment of pASO/DhBD23 (Fig. 7c and d) while the downregulation of TGF-β was far less effective by treatment of pASO (5% in epithelial cells and 28% in macrophages, respectively). These results showed that the pASO/DhBD23 complex was distributed in broad regions of the lung including fibroblasts, thereby suggesting the possibility of a universal lung-targeted therapeutic platform, to treat various pulmonary diseases. 3.6. Alleviation of pulmonary fibrosis by the pASO/DhBD23 complex Having observed successful downregulation of TGF-β in the lung tissue by systemic delivery of the pASO/DhBD23 complex, we histologically examined whether fibrosis in the lung could eventually be alleviated. In contrast to the spacious mesh-like lung tissue in healthy Fig. 4. Biodistribution study in the pulmonary fibrosis mouse model.

Kim, et al. Journal of Controlled Release 322 (2020) 108–121 114 mice, highly dense fibrous tissue was observed in the lung of the bleomycin-treated mice (PBS). The density of the fibrotic region was significantly decreased with pASO/DhBD23 treatment, whereas treatment with pASO failed to alleviate fibrosis. Since TGF-β regulates the expression of collagen, an increased level of collagen has commonly been used as an indicator of fibrosis [44]. Thus, we also evaluated the Fig. 5.

Flow cytometry analysis of cellular uptake of pASO and pASO/DhBD23 in (a) bEnd.3 cells and (b) MLg cells (mean ± SEM, n = 3; *P < 0.05 and ***P < 0.001 vs. PBS; #P < 0.05 and ###P < 0.001 vs. pASO/DhBD23).

Journal of Controlled Release 322 (2020) 108–121 115 collagen expression level in the fibrosis model. Collagen expression in the lung tissue sections was visualized as a blue color using Masson's trichrome staining and quantified by image analysis. The deposition of collagen was increased by 2-fold in fibrosis, compared with normal tissue (Fig. 8a and b). A decrease in collagen level (by ca. 16%) was observed following treatment with pASO/DhBD23. However, treatments of pASO failed to reduce the collagen expression level. These results indicate that the knock-down of TGF-β in the lung by pASO/ DhBD23 could indeed downregulate collagen expression, thereby alleviating pulmonary fibrosis. Fig. 6.

TGF-β level was quantified using Image J software (mean ± SEM, n = 3; **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001 vs. Healthy Mice; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 and ###P < 0.001 vs. pASO/DhBD23). J. Kim, et al. Journal of Controlled Release 322 (2020) 108–121 116 3.7. In vivo toxicity of the pASO/DhBD23 complex Next, following the successful demonstration of the therapeutic efficacy of pASO/DhBD23, we finally assessed the in vivo toxicity. Healthy and pulmonary fibrosis-induced mice were treated with the formulations using the same schedule employed for the in vivo efficacy study and major organs (heart, lung, kidney, liver, and spleen) of the treated mice were examined using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. In the pASO and pASO/DhBD23-treated fibrosis groups, no distinctive morphological differences in the heart, kidney, and liver were observed compared to the healthy group (Fig. 9a). With the development of lung fibrosis, alveolar infiltration of inflammatory cells and the formation of intra-alveolar hyaline membranes in the PBS and pASO-treated groups were significantly greater than those of the healthy group while pASO/ DhBD23-treated group exhibited reduced tissue damage. However, splenic nodules (blue-stained parts) were considerably reduced by all the treatments, including the injection of PBS (Fig. 9b) in the fibrosis group, with no noticeable differences following treatments in healthy mice (Fig. 9b and c). This indicates that the toxicity detected in the spleen of the fibrosis model was not caused by pASO or pASO/DhBD23, but rather by bleomycin, which has previously been reported to reduce splenic lymphocytes [45]. Therefore, we confirmed that pASO and pASO/DhBD23 did not induce any notable systemic toxicity. Additionally, when we examined morphology of tissues (Fig. S10a and S10b) and splenic nodules (Fig. S10c) in sections from DhBD23-treated mice, no considerable systemic toxicity was observed, indicating that DhBD23 itself does not show in vivo toxicity. Compared to other well-known cationic cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) such as TAT peptide from HIV and synthetic arginine nonamer (R9), DhBD23 is a human peptide and therefore expected to be less cytotoxic to mammalian cells even with higher number of cationic residues (24 in DhBD23 vs. 8 in TAT or 9 in R9). Unlike other cationic peptides derived from bacterial, viral, or unnatural sequences showing cytotoxicity against eukaryotic cells [46–49], human β-defensins show a certain level of specific cytotoxicity for bacterial cells having the anionic cell membrane over mammalian cells having the zwitterionic cell membrane [50,51]. While DhBD23 does not intrinsically have lungtargeting properties, it can easily form self-aggregated microparticles suitable for lung accumulation after complexation with nucleic acids, because it has hydrophobic residues forming β-strand as other hBDs as Fig. 7. TGF-β expression in (a) fibroblasts (α-SMA-positive), (b) endothelial cells (CD31-positive), (c) epithelial cells (pro-SPC-positive), and (d) macrophages (F4/ 80-positive) in lung tissue. The positive cells in the confocal microscopic images (magnification: ×400) of 30 section slides (10 slides per mouse) were counted using Image J software for the analysis (mean ± SEM, n = 3; **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001 vs. Healthy Mice; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 and ###P < 0.001 vs. pASO/ DhBD23). J. Kim, et al. Journal of Controlled Release 322 (2020) 108–121 117 well as the multiple cationic charges [52]. By contrast, HIV-TAT and R9 peptides are mostly composed of cationic residues and thereby have less aggregation power to form microparticles with nucleic acids. After accumulation in the lung capillary, microparticles need to be fragmented into smaller nanoparticles in the physiological conditions to avoid pulmonary embolism and enhance endothelial cell uptake. The pASO/DhBD23 microparticles are formed by non-covalent interactions and composed of fully biocompatible materials, such as DNA and human-derived peptide, which are expected to be fragmented by shear stress or degraded by blood flow in the capillary. This is an advantage of pASO/DhBD23 to be used as a lung-targeted drug carrier over other types of microparticles that cannot be fragmented into nanoparticles in the physiological conditions. Indeed, the size of aggregates made by pASO/DhBD23 and albumin was decreased to ~ 500 nm after shear stress applied using pipetting (Fig. S11). 4. Conclusions In conclusion, we developed a pASO/DhBD23 complex by utilizing two highly biocompatible materials, DNA and the human-derived cationic peptide. Complexation with DhBD23 provided pASO the serum stability, the cellular uptake property, and the lung-targeting ability Fig. 8.

Kim, et al. Journal of Controlled Release 322 (2020) 108–121 118 that are critically required to treat pulmonary diseases via systemic delivery. With the antisense sequence targeting TGF-β, the lung-delivered complex downregulated the target mRNA and protein, subsequently alleviating pulmonary fibrosis in an animal model without inducing any considerable systemic toxicity. As the sequence of ASO is easily editable depending on the target, without affecting the complexation property with DhBD23, pASO/DhBD23 is a promising platform for gene therapy that could potentially be applied to promptly treat many other pulmonary diseases.
