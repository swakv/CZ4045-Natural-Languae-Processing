Blood glucose management is important for cardiovascular
surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass. The usefulness of an
artificial pancreas apparatus (STG-55) to control blood glucose in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass was
investigated. Subjects comprised 44 patients using the artificial pancreas during cardiopulmonary bypass between June
2016 and March 2017; 55 were initially enrolled, but 11 were
excluded because of blood removal failure. Patients were
divided into a monitoring group in which blood glucose levels
were only monitored using the artificial pancreas (11 patients:
six people with diabetes and 5 people without diabetes) and a
management group with glycemic control by automatic insulin administration using the artificial pancreas (33 patients:
people with diabetes and 21 people without diabetes). Mean
maximum blood glucose levels and variation ranges significantly differed between the monitoring and management
groups (p = 0.02). The variation range significantly differed
between people with and without diabetes in the monitoring group (p = 0.008), but not in the management group. The
artificial pancreas apparatus continuously and accurately
reflected glycemic variations, facilitating strict and favorable
control. ASAIO Journal 2019; 65:503–508.

Perioperative blood glucose management is important for
cardiovascular surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass. Glucose metabolism is normally maintained by insulin, glucagon,
cortisol, growth hormone, and epinephrine; however, abnormalities are induced by surgery, cardiopulmonary bypass, and
hypothermia.1–3 Although blood glucose levels (standard fasting glucose level: 80–110mg/dl) increase during extracorporeal circulation, insulin is not sufficiently secreted.4
The artificial pancreas apparatus (STG-55, Nikkiso, Tokyo,
Japan) is a closed-loop bedside device developed in Japan that
is capable of continuously measuring blood glucose levels and
automatically administering insulin and glucose to control blood
glucose at a specified level.5
 Introduction of an artificial pancreas
apparatus was reported to reduce the incidence of surgical site
infection (SSI) and postoperative infection, frequencies of blood
sampling and safety confirmation, and incidence of events and
hypoglycemia, decreasing the labor burden on intensive care
unit (ICU) staff in the digestive surgery field.6,7 However, it has
not yet been clinically applied in the cardiovascular surgery field.
In the current study, we managed blood glucose levels with the
artificial pancreas apparatus during open heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and evaluated its usefulness.
Subjects and Methods
Study Population
The artificial pancreas apparatus (STG-55, Nikkiso, Tokyo,
Japan; Figure 1) is a closed-loop system device that continuously collects venous blood at 2ml/h through an intravenous
indwelling needle, continuously measures blood glucose,
and automatically injects insulin and glucose corresponding to the measured glucose level. Its design is presented in
Figure 1. The external dimensions are 375×425×1,350mm
and it weighs 36kg. Fifty-five patients underwent scheduled
cardiovascular surgery using the artificial pancreas apparatus
(STG-55, Nikkiso, Tokyo, Japan) at our hospital between June
2016 and March 2017. In total, 55 consecutive patients scheduled for cardiovascular surgery who gave consent to the use
of the artificial pancreas apparatus were selected as subjects
in a nonrandomized manner. Eleven patients for whom blood
glucose sampling was not possible because of blood removal
failure were excluded, and, thus, 44 patients were examined.
Among these patients, cardiovascular surgery was performed
for valvular disease in 21, for a large blood vessel in 11, for the
coronary artery in nine, and for others in three. Blood glucose
levels were measured using the artificial pancreas apparatus
in all patients. Patients were divided into 11 for whom insulin was appropriately administered following the sliding scale
(monitoring group) and 33 for whom insulin was automatically
administered using the artificial pancreas apparatus (management group). This study was approved by the ethics committees of Hyogo College of Medicine. Our institutional approval
number of this study is 2309.
Study Design
Investigation items were age, height, body weight, sex, the
presence or absence of diabetes, preoperative fasting blood
glucose, preoperative HbA1c, intraoperative blood loss, the
aortic cross-clamp time, cardiopulmonary bypass time, operative time, intraoperative balance, and postoperative drainage
blood loss. Comparative investigation items were maximum
and minimum blood glucose levels and the range of blood glucose level variations. In addition, the range of blood glucose

level variations was compared between five people without
diabetes and six people with diabetes in the monitoring group
and between 21 people without diabetes and 12 people with
diabetes in the management group.
Data Collection
The blood removal route was connected to the patient simultaneously with the initiation of surgery, and the use of the
artificial pancreas was initiated only with the blood glucose
measurement mode in the monitoring group, in which blood
glucose was managed by administering insulin when the blood
glucose level was 200mg/dl or higher employing a sliding scale
(defined as the conventional method). In addition, in the monitoring group, blood glucose was controlled using the method
employed before initiation of this study, i.e., conventional management employing the sliding scale as performed for other
patients treated by cardiovascular surgery, and only blood glucose was measured for monitoring using the artificial pancreas
apparatus. In the management group, the use of the artificial
pancreas was initiated with the treatment mode, setting the target blood glucose level at 80–180mg/dl. The use of the apparatus was completed after approximately 24 hours including its
use in postoperative ICU in both groups. Regarding the blood
removal route for sampling, a single forearm venous route or
lower limb venous route was secured using a 20 G indwelling
needle in all patients. In blood glucose management using the
conventional method, blood glucose levels were measured continuously and checked every 30 minutes during surgery, 5 units
of insulin (Humulin R) was administered when it was 200mg/dl
or higher, and levels were then rechecked after 30 minutes. During cardiopulmonary bypass, blood glucose levels were measured immediately after the initiation of cardioplegia, 5 units of
insulin (Humulin R) was administered when it was 200mg/dl or
higher, and levels were then rechecked after 30 minutes. When
blood glucose levels were lower than 80mg/dl, 20g of glucose
was administered, followed by rechecking after 30 minutes. In
postoperative ICU, insulin (Humulin R) was administered when
blood glucose levels were 200mg/dl or higher following the
sliding scale every 6 hours, and 20g of glucose was administered when levels were lower than 80mg/dl.
Statistical Analysis
Regarding blood glucose levels, the values automatically
measured by the artificial pancreas were used. The maximum
and minimum levels and variation range (maximum level–
minimum level) were calculated from the values measured by
the artificial pancreas in each patient, and the mean ± standard
deviations were calculated in each group. Statistical analyses
were performed using JMP 12.2.0 (SAS Institute Japan, Tokyo,
Japan). The Student’s t-test (for continuous variables with a normal distribution), Mann–Whitney U test (for continuous variables with non-normal distribution), χ2
 test, or Fisher’s exact
test (nominal scale) was used for between-group comparison,
and a p value less than 0.05 was considered to be significant.
Results
Patient backgrounds are shown in Table 1. No significant
differences were observed in age, height, body weight, sex,
the presence or absence of diabetes, preoperative fasting blood
glucose, preoperative HbA1c, intraoperative blood loss, aortic
cross-clamp time, extracorporeal circulation time, operative
time, intraoperative balance, or postoperative drainage blood
loss between the monitoring and management groups.

ARTIFICIAL PANCREAS FOR CVS 505
Maximum blood glucose levels during the use of the artificial pancreas were 218.4±51.0 and 178.2±27.4 mg/dl in
the monitoring and management groups, respectively, with
levels being significantly lower in the management group
(p = 0.021; Figure 2A). Minimum blood glucose levels were
106.0±19.4 and 97.0±15.9 mg/dl, respectively, showing no
significant differences between the two groups (p = 0.228;
Figure 2B). The ranges of blood glucose level variations
were 114.2±40.2 and 81.2±22.8 mg/dl in the monitoring
and management groups, respectively, with the variation
range being significantly smaller in the management group
(p = 0.018; Figure 2C). Infectious complications developed in
two patients: a surgical site infection at the great saphenous
vein in the crus and an infection of the superficial layer of
the median chest wound, and both patients belonged to the
monitoring group. The incidence of infectious complications
was 18% (2/11) in the monitoring group and 0% (0/33) in the
management group, and, thus, was significantly lower in the
management group (p = 0.012).
The ranges of blood glucose level variations in people
without diabetes and people with diabetes in the monitoring group were 76.6±20.7 and 145.6±17.1 mg/dl, respectively, with the variation range being significantly larger in
people with diabetes (p = 0.008). In contrast, no significant
differences were noted in the management group (people
without diabetes versus people with diabetes: 75.8±23.6
vs. 90.8±18.6 mg/dl; p = 0.064; Figure 3), i.e., variations in
blood glucose levels may be inhibited by blood glucose management using the artificial pancreas regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes.

Discussion
The effectiveness of continuous blood glucose monitoring
and blood glucose management using an artificial pancreas
apparatus has occasionally been reported in the digestive surgery, anesthesiology, and internal medical fields8–10; however,
only changes in blood glucose levels in a patient9
 and the
investigation of a blood sampling method during the use of an
artificial pancreas apparatus in patients during cardiopulmonary bypass11 have been described in the cardiovascular surgery field. Changes in blood glucose levels and blood glucose
management during the perioperative period of cardiovascular surgery using an artificial pancreas apparatus have not yet
been reported because the circuit readily becomes unusable
because of blood removal failure caused by low perfusion in
the peripheral circulation during cardiopulmonary bypass11
and the high cost. In the current study, blood removal failure
occurred in 11 (20%) of 55 patients during cardiopulmonary
bypass, and, thus, has the potential to limit future use. Blood
removal failure can be resolved by selecting a peripheral vein
with a large diameter unlikely to collapse for the blood removal
route, but it is difficult in many cases because of patient factors. Connection to the circuit prevents blood removal failure
during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB),11 but this method cannot be employed after completion of CPB. Therefore, a blood
removal route has to be secured in the patient. Accordingly,
there may be room for improvement regarding the indwelling needle for the blood removal route. The problem of blood
removal failure should be continuously investigated for the use
of the artificial pancreas apparatus.
Regarding the cost, the price of this artificial pancreas apparatus is approximately $50,000 (USD) and that of the circuit
exchanged every 24 hours is approximately $270. It became
covered by national health insurance in 2016 in Japan and it
costs approximately $316×2 for a 24 hour single use (the cost
is doubled when use extends to the following day), resulting in
approximately $632 in total. According to reports from other
fields, reduction in the incidence of postoperative infection and
duration of hospital stay can be expected, and reducing effects
were noted compared with the cost (approximately $4,500)
of standard care.6
 Regarding the invasiveness and complications of attachment to this apparatus, no hypoglycemic attack
occurred and only the peripheral route needs to be secured,
being relatively low-invasive for patients. No study comparing
the cost of postoperative complications has been reported and
it remains to be investigated.
Studies have been conducted on perioperative blood glucose
management in digestive surgery. In the normoglycemia in intensive care evaluation and survival using glucose algorithm regulation (NICE-SUGAR) Study, the mortality rate was lower in the
group with blood glucose levels controlled at 180mg/dl or lower
than in the group with precise control at 81–108mg/dl.12 The
Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) also reported in its proposal
that it is better to control intraoperative blood glucose levels at
180mg/dl or lower and continuous administration is superior to
subcutaneous administration for the dosing of insulin in cardiac
surgery field.13 In the ICU of our hospital, the upper limit of blood
glucose control is set at 200mg/dl based on the proposal for perioperative blood glucose by the US centers for disease control
and prevention (CDC) guidelines.14 Accordingly, the upper limit
was set at 200mg/dl in the monitoring group, while the target
level was set at 80–180mg/dl in the management group. The
range (80–180mg/dl) of the target level was set in the management group because too precise Intensive Insulin Therapy in the
perioperative period did not contribute to decreasing mortality
rates in recent studies2,15–17 and studies opposing Intensive Insulin
Therapy have occasionally been reported.8,12,18,19 On the other
hand, the highest blood glucose level during cardiopulmonary
bypass has been reported to be an independent risk factor for a
high mortality rate and complications.20 The artificial pancreas

may reduce the mortality rate with further study. Furthermore, the
suppression of blood glucose level variations was shown to play
an important role in blood glucose management.18,21,22 The use of
the artificial pancreas significantly narrowed the range of blood
glucose level variations, demonstrating its efficacy for blood glucose control. Reductions in blood glucose level variations were
greater in the management group than those achieved by conventional management, even in comparisons of all patients in the
presence or absence of diabetes, demonstrating that the artificial
pancreas apparatus is effective in people without diabetes, but it
is more effective in people with diabetes. As variation in blood
glucose and a high blood glucose level can be prevented, and
blood glucose can be strictly controlled using this device, it may
be sufficiently used as auxiliary means to maintain blood glucose
at a constant level. Regarding perioperative stress-induced hyperglycemia, a previous study reported that when patients were continuously exposed to perioperative hyperglycemia, the outcomes
of people without diabetes were poorer than those of people
with diabetes23; however, blood glucose management using the
artificial pancreas may also be sufficiently effective for people
without diabetes. The target glucose level differed between the
groups. A study with a uniform target glucose level may be necessary. Although the target blood glucose level was different
between the two groups, the blood glucose level was able to be
controlled within the specified range using the artificial pancreas
apparatus, suggesting that the range of variation and maximum
level of blood glucose can be freely controlled. Therefore, the
efficacy of blood glucose management using the artificial pancreas apparatus was demonstrated.
A number of studies have investigated the relationship
between perioperative blood glucose management and infectious complications. The risk of sepsis may be significantly
reduced by Intensive Insulin Therapy.12,19,24 And a high blood
glucose level was shown to promote and aggravate wound
infection and sepsis,24,25 showing that a high postoperative
blood glucose level needs to be prevented. However, no significant reductions in the incidence of infection were detected
in a pooled analysis17 of literature on the development of
wound infection, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, and combinations of these infections.15,16,26–29 In the current study, no
infectious complications occurred in the management group,
whereas their incidence was 18% in the monitoring group;
however, these results may not be sufficient evidence because
the number of patients was small and the incidence of infectious complications is low in the cardiovascular surgery field.
Furthermore, problems, such as blood glucose control for more
than 24 hours after surgery and use of the artificial pancreas
apparatus and nutrition management, need to be addressed.
It may be necessary to perform a study on the glucose level,
insulin dose, dietary restriction, and factors concerning food
intake after control by the artificial pancreas.
The artificial pancreas apparatus is not yet extensively
used in the cardiovascular surgery field and there are limitations, such as its cost and blood removal failure; however, it
is minimally invasive and enables safe and continuous blood
glucose measurements and management. It is superior to the
conventional method for blood glucose management and
may be very useful for people with diabetes. Further studies on its usefulness are warranted. Blood glucose control by
the artificial pancreas apparatus may also be useful for not
only teams engaged in perioperative blood glucose control
(cardiovascular surgeons, anesthesiologists, cardiopulmonary
bypass technologists, surgical nurses, ICU physicians, and
ICU nurses) but also medical workers involved in blood glucose control in several fields (digestive surgery, gastroenterology, medical metabolism, and ICUs).
In conclusion, variations in blood glucose levels were continuously measured in the perioperative period of cardiovascular surgery using the artificial pancreas apparatus and strict
control was achieved. In addition, variations in blood glucose
levels were reduced more, even in people with diabetes, than
by the conventional method. The present results also demonstrated that infectious complications may be reduced.
