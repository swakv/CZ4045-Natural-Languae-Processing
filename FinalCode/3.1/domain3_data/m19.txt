Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)–DQ8 transdimer (HLA-DQA1*0501/DQB1*0302) confers exceptionally high risk
in autoimmune diabetes. However, little is known about HLA-DQ8 transdimer–restricted CD4 T cell recognition,
an event crucial for triggering HLA-DQ8 transdimer–specific anti-islet immunity. Here, we report a high degree
of epitope overlap and T cell promiscuity between susceptible HLA-DQ8 and HLA-DQ8 transdimer. Despite preservation of putative residues for T cell receptor (TCR) contact, stronger disease-associated responses to crossreactive, immunodominant islet epitopes are elicited by HLA-DQ8 transdimer. Mutagenesis at the chain of
HLA-DQ8 transdimer in complex with the disease-relevant GAD65250–266 peptide and in silico analysis reveal
the DQ 52 residue located within the N-terminal edge of the peptide-binding cleft for the enhanced T cell reactivity, altering avidity and biophysical affinity between TCR and HLA-peptide complexes. Accordingly, a structurally promiscuous but nondegenerate TCR-HLA-peptide interface is pivotal for HLA-DQ8 transdimer–mediated
autoimmune diabetes.
INTRODUCTION
Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes, also known as human
leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes in humans, are the prominent susceptibility factor for many autoimmune diseases, including multiple
sclerosis (MS), autoimmune diabetes (type 1 diabetes or T1D), and
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Several hypotheses for MHC-linked susceptibility in autoimmune diseases have been proposed, including
preferential accommodation of self-peptides or altered self-peptides
derived from the target organ of each disease by MHC molecules,
promotion of autoimmunity through molecular mimicry between
self- and microbial antigens, and unstable trimolecular interactions
among the T cell receptor (TCR)–peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes
that facilitate the escape of self-reactive T cells from negative selection
[recent reviews in (1, 2)]. However, because of limited knowledge of
T cell epitopes and scarcity of self-reactive T cells, the molecular and
structural association between susceptible alleles and T cell autoreactivity is not clearly understood.
T1D is a chronic disease that causes severe loss of insulinproducing cells in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. T1D is predominantly linked to genetically predisposed individuals carrying
HLA-DQ8 (encoded by HLA-DQA1*0301-DQB1*0302 and hereafter referred to as DQ8cis) or HLA-DQ2 (encoded by HLADQA1*0501-DQB1*0201 and hereafter referred to as DQ2cis)
haplotypes (3, 4). HLA-DQ8/DQ2 heterozygous individuals confer
a synergistically higher risk for disease (5–7). Epidemiological studies
link this high risk to the naturally occurring trans-complementary
molecule HLA-DQ8 transdimer (hereafter referred to as DQ8trans),
consisting of the DQ2cis chain (DQA1*0501) and the DQ8cis chain
(DQB1*0302) (5–7). The other trans-complementary molecule HLA-DQ2
transdimer, consisting of the DQ8cis chain (DQA1*0301) and
the DQ2cis chain (DQB1*0201), also confers T1D risk but to a
lesser extent (7).
Despite conferring exceptionally high risk in T1D, little is known
about the DQ8trans-restricted epitope repertoire and T cell recognition. DQ8cis and DQ8trans molecules have an identical  chain
(DQB1*0302). Protein sequence alignment by BLAST (Basic Local
Alignment Search Tool) reveals a high similarity between the chain
of DQ8cis (DQA1*0301) and the chain of DQ8trans (DQA1*0501),
but with distinct residues, namely, 23, 31, 37, 44, 47, 48, 50,
52, 72, and 73, that are proximal to or within the peptide-binding
cleft (8, 9). A special feature of the DQ susceptibility alleles in T1D
is the absence of an aspartic acid residue at position 57 of the  chain
(4), which leads to a highly skewed peptide repertoire favoring a
negative charge at the p9 anchor in DQ8cis (10, 11). Although the
differences in   chain may lead to distinct peptide-binding specificities
between DQ8cis and DQ8trans (12), cross-recognition of both DQ8cis
and DQ8trans by CD4+
 T cell clones specific for some self-epitopes
has been reported (13–16), suggesting convergence of TCR footprints
onto both alleles (9) due to “missing the differences” form of molecular
mimicry. In light of this, elucidating the molecular basis of T cell
recognition of DQ8cis/trans molecules may advance the understanding
of DQ8trans-specific immunity and the mechanism by which DQ8trans
increases the risk for T1D.
In this study, we investigate the structural and functional attributes
of DQ8cis/trans that are critical to T1D progression by an integrated
in vitro, direct ex vivo, biophysical, and in silico analysis of specific

 T cells using DQ8cis, DQ2cis, and DQ8trans tetramer reagents.
We find a high degree of T cell promiscuity between DQ8cis and
DQ8trans for self- and nonself-antigens. T cells specific for crossreactive, disease-relevant islet epitopes show an enhanced responsiveness toward DQ8trans-peptide (pDQ8trans) complexes compared
to DQ8cis-peptide (pDQ8cis) complexes, as a result of increased
TCR-pDQ8trans affinity. Modified TCR recognition toward immunodominant and disease-relevant epitopes is associated with DQ  
chain residues at the N-terminal end of peptide-binding cleft that
potentially involves reorientation of the epitopes under the context
of different DQ   chains. Thus, preferential TCR cross-recognition
of pDQ8trans complexes through specific DQ   chain residues provides a molecular explanation for the extremely high risk of developing T1D that is conferred by DQ8trans.
RESULTS
A high degree of epitope sharing and T cell promiscuity is
observed between T1D-susceptible DQ8cis and
DQ8trans alleles
We assessed the structural and functional properties of DQ8/DQ2
cis and trans molecules by examination of T cells specific for common
Influenza A epitopes, as well as multiple T1D-associated islet antigen
epitopes. Tetramer-guided epitope mapping (17) was applied to
identify influenza-specific epitopes. Briefly, total CD4+
 T cells from
multiple DQ8+
DQ2+
 participants were stimulated using pooled peptides spanning Influenza A/New Caledonia/20/1999 Hemagglutinin
(H1HA or HA) and Influenza A/New York/318/2003 Nucleoprotein
(H1NP or NP). After culturing for 14 days, antigenic epitopes were
identified with DQ8cis, DQ2cis, and DQ8trans tetramers. A representative DQ8trans tetramer staining for pooled and individual epitope
mapping of H1HA is shown in fig. S1. We observed extensive epitope
sharing between DQ8cis and DQ8trans for Influenza A antigens
(Fig. 1A and Table 1). Most identified epitopes were stained by both
tetramers (Table 1, group I). Peptides HA102–118/HA108–124, HA274–290/
HA280–296, HA398–414/HA404–420, NP288–304/NP294–310, and NP480–496/
NP486–498 were single overlapping epitopes as specific T cells were
stained by tetramers with either peptide. In vitro expanded primary
T cells specific for HA186–202, HA340–356, HA422–438, HA440–456, HA452–468,
NP175–191, and NP240–256, by contrast, were visualized by either DQ8cis
or DQ8trans tetramer only (Table 1, group II, group III, unique
epitopes for DQ8cis, and inconclusive). To confirm restriction of
each cis- or transdimer, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells,
which are commonly used for antigen presentation studies (18, 19),
Common Influenza A antigens
Fig. 1. A high degree of epitope sharing and T cell promiscuity is observed between DQ8cis and DQ8trans for influenza and islet antigens. (A) A high degree of
epitope overlap (highlighted in red) was observed between DQ8cis- and DQ8trans-restricted influenza-specific T cells. In contrast, only one DQ2cis-restricted epitope
(HA102–118/HA108–124) was accommodated by DQ8cis/trans. Numbers indicate epitopes shared between DQ8cis, DQ2cis, and DQ8trans or exclusively presented by DQ8cis,
DQ2cis, or DQ8trans. Each overlapping epitope (HA102–118/HA108–124, HA274–290/HA280–296, HA398–414/HA404–420, NP288–304/NP294–310, or NP480–496/NP486–498) was viewed as
one epitope. (B and C) Cross-recognition of islet-specific clones was confirmed by T cell reactivity in the presence of 500 nM peptides. Black and white bars represent T cell
reactivity stimulated by DQ8cis- and DQ8trans-transfected HEK293 cells, respectively. Error bars represent SDs among three experiments. SI, stimulation index.

were transfected with DQcis or DQtrans expression constructs.
DQ8cis-, DQ2cis-, DQ8trans-, and DQ2trans-transfected HEK293
cells had comparable surface DQ expression, as determined by the
mean fluorescence intensity of anti-DQ (SPVL3) antibody staining
(fig. S1C). Responses of T cell clones specific for HA186–202, HA440–456,
NP175–191, and NP240–256 indicated that these cells could be activated
by either DQ8cis or DQ8trans in T cell proliferation assay. On the
other hand, multiple DQ8cis-restricted HA452–468-specific clones
from two individuals failed to respond to pDQ8trans in T cell proliferation assay, confirming HA452–468 as a unique DQ8cis epitope.
We were unable to isolate DQ8cis-restricted HA340–356- and
HA422–438-specific lines or clones to attribute the recognition of these
specificities to pDQ8trans. In contrast, only one DQ2cis-restricted
HA peptide (HA102–118/HA108–124) was accommodated by DQ8cis/
trans (Fig. 1A and table S1).
The identification of overlapping Influenza A epitope repertoires
between DQ8cis and DQ8trans prompted us to investigate whether
cross-recognition of peptides presented by both restriction elements
also occurs in islet antigens. We screened a total of 130 possible
DQ8cis/trans-binding peptides from important islet antigens, specifically from chromogranin A, cyproheptadine, islet autoantigen
69 (ICA69), islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit–
related protein (IGRP), -aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor–
associated protein, glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65),
phogrin, preproinsulin, tyrosine phosphatase–related islet antigen–2
(IA-2), secretory granule proteins, synaptic adhesion molecules, and

zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8) (for peptide selection, see Materials and
Methods). The list included several peptides exclusively presented
by DQ8trans (12). We identified eight previously unknown peptides
(Table 1) that elicited in vitro responses from peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of T1D participants. No T cell responses
to peptides exclusively presented by DQ8trans (12) were detected.
Cross-reactivity to these eight epitopes together with InsB11–24,
GAD65121–140, and GAD65250–266, which were published in our previous studies (20, 21), was examined by tetramer staining and functional responses of T cell clones. To avoid any bias in TCR selection
due to the presence of DQ8trans, we set up stimulation in DQ8+
DQ2−
participants and isolated clones using DQ8cis tetramers. GAD65250–266-,
InsB11–24-, IA-2761–777–, IA-2957–972–, IGRP306–320-, and ZnT815–29-
specific clones from several participants were stained by both DQ8cis
and DQ8trans tetramers (fig. S2A). Cross-recognition of these six
epitopes was confirmed by T cell reactivity (Fig. 1, B and C). Clones
specific for GAD65121–140, IA-2168–182, IA-2273–287, ICA69297–311, and
Phogrin323–337 were not effectively stained by DQ8trans tetramers
(fig. S2B) but proliferated in response to pDQ8trans (Fig. 1B).
Together, 16 of 19 (84%) influenza epitopes and 11 of 11 islet epitopes
(100%) were cross-recognized.
Cross-recognition ofislet-specific T cells occurs in ex vivo
unmanipulated, polyclonal populations
As the aforementioned cross-reactivity was observed by using T cell
clones/lines, we scrutinized the cross-recognition of polyclonal and
unmanipulated islet-specific T cells by direct ex vivo analysis in
DQ8+
DQ2−
 participants. GAD65250–266- and IA-2957–972–specific cells
were investigated as these two epitopes elicited in vitro responses in
more than half of T1D participants screened. T cell cross-recognition
to polyclonal DQ8cis/GAD65250–266-specific and DQ8trans/
GAD65250–266-specific cells was validated by double staining of
ex vivo enriched cells with DQ8cis and DQ8trans tetramers [Fig. 2A;
the specificity of ex vivo staining for DQ8/GAD65250–266 has been
demonstrated in our previous study (20)]. In contrast, IA-2957–972–
specific T cells could only be effectively visualized by DQ8trans
tetramers; however, functional cross-reactivity and specificity of the
staining was revealed when ex vivo sorted DQ8trans/IA-2957–972–
specific clones from DQ8 (DQA1*0301-DQB1*0302) homozygous
patients were stimulated with the specific peptide presented by DQ8cis
or DQ8trans (Fig. 2B). A representative ex vivo staining from one
T1D and one healthy participant is shown in fig. S2. Results of
ex vivo staining experiments are summarized in table S2. Higher
frequencies of GAD65250–266- and IA-2957–972–specific cells were observed in both DQ8+
 patients (Fig. 2, C and D).
Overall, our in vitro and ex vivo data suggested that GAD65250–266-
and IA-2957–972–specific T cells are immunodominant and disease
relevant in human T1D, and T cell promiscuity in the context of
DQ8cis/trans for these two epitopes was present in unmanipulated,
polyclonal T cell populations.
DQ8cis- andDQ8trans-restricted epitopes elicit T cell
responses by conserved putative TCR contact residues
We next investigated whether DQ8cis/trans cross-reactivity to
InsB11–24 (the primary autoantigen in the nonobese diabetic
mouse model and relevant in human T1D (21, 22)), GAD65250–266,
and IA-2957–972 epitopes was mediated by the same TCR recognition
sites using single-site alanine scanning mutagenesis. Several clones
from different participants were investigated, and a representative
result was shown in fig. S3B. Previous and current data demonstrated
that the minimal T cell epitopes for GAD65250–266, InsB11–24, and
IA-2957–972 are GAD65253–261 (23), InsB14–22 (21), and IA-2961–969
(fig. S3A), respectively. TCRs interacted with GAD65250–263, InsB11–24,
and IA-2957–972 across the entire peptide region, as mutations at both
middle and end residues abolished the recognition of T cell clones.
T cell reactivity profiles for these epitopes were similar between
DQ8cis and DQ8trans as substitutions at given positions of the
epitope of the DQ8cis/trans complexes have very similar to identical
effects on the cognate T cell clones. These data indicate that both
molecules elicit T cell responses via the same TCR recognition motif
(fig. S3B). Studies by Eerligh et al. (24) suggest that the DQ8 cis- and
transdimers present InsB6–22 in a different binding register. This
discrepancy is likely accounted for by a single amino acid shift in the
antigenic motif recognized by our insulin clones [14ALYLVCGER22
(21), the predominant form recognized in DQ8+
 individuals (25)]
versus those of Eerligh et al. (13EALYLVCGE21).
Islet autoimmunity is promoted by DQ8trans
The functional implication of T cell cross-reactivity to immunodominant InsB11–24, GAD65250–266, and IA-2957–972 epitopes was explored using islet-specific clones isolated with DQ8cis tetramers from
in vitro expanded cultures of memory CD4+
 T cells in multiple DQ8+
T1D participants. All six GAD65250–266 clones proliferated with pDQ8cis
and pDQ8trans, but pDQ8trans elicited greater responses across all
but one of the clones (Fig. 3A). Similarly, all IA-2957–972–specific clones
proliferated more strongly in response to DQ8trans when stimulated
with specific peptide (Fig. 3B). pDQ8trans also induced greater cytokine production from cross-reactive T cell clones that recognized
pDQ8trans better, including significantly more interferon- (IFN-)
secretion from pDQ8trans-induced GAD65250–266-specific clones
[Fig. 3C and table S3, P < 0.05 by paired t tests, compared to 0.2574
for interleukin-4 (IL-4) and 0.1862 for interleukin-10 (IL-10)]. Similar
IFN-, IL-4, and IL-10 secretion results as to GAD65250–266-specific
clones were seen for IA-2957–972–specific clones (Fig. 3C and table S3).
Although InsB11–24-specific clones did not proliferate strongly in
response to peptide stimulation, higher levels of IFN- secretion were
induced (from three different InsB11–24 clones) by pDQ8trans, compared to the levels of IFN- induced by pDQ8cis (Fig. 3C). A summary
of the T cell clones, their proliferative capacity, and cytokine secretion
is summarized in table S3. Thus, islet-specific cross-reactive T cells
respond more strongly to DQ8trans-presented peptides than DQ8cispresented peptides and produce higher amounts of proinflammatory
cytokines associated with T1D pathogenesis in the former compared
to the latter case, regardless of the DQ status (DQ8+
DQ2−
 or
DQ8+
DQ2+
) of the host.
Enhanced T cell recognition ofDQ8trans/GAD65250–266 is
correlated with biophysical interactions and
functional avidity
A direct correlation exists between two-dimensional (2D) affinity
and T cell functional responses (26, 27). We next investigated the
2D affinity and cross-recognition of pDQ8cis and pDQ8trans to
GAD65250–266-specific CD4 T cells using purified covalent DQ8cis- or
DQ8trans-GAD65250–266 protein complexes. We found that clones
03-C1, 05-C1, and 07-C1 all had significantly higher affinity (>2-fold)
for the pDQ8trans molecule (Fig. 4A), which would be in agreement

with the observed increases in the stimulation index (SI) (Fig. 3A). In
contrast, the 09-C1 clone had higher affinity for and was more responsive to pDQ8cis (Figs. 4A and 3A, respectively). We also evaluated the 2D
affinity of influenza matrix protein–specific clone and its 2D affinity
also correlated with T cell function. Dose-response curves of T cells
have been used to generate functional avidity comparisons between
T cells. The functional avidity of GAD65250–266-specific T cell clones
was also correlated with pMHC potency as the dose-response curves
suggested that higher pDQ8cis concentrations were required to
reach a similar response to that of pDQ8trans (Fig. 4B). On the other
hand, no apparent variation in functional avidity between DQ8cis
and DQ8trans for GAD65250–266-specific T cell clone 09-C1, which
exhibited stronger responses and biophysical interactions for DQ8cis,
was observed (Fig. 4B). The lack of difference might be associated
Fig. 3. pDQ8trans most often elicit stronger disease-associated responses from cross-reactive islet-specific T cell clones. (A) All but one GAD65250–266-specific
clones were activated more vigorously by DQ8trans in the presence of 50 and 500 nM peptides. (B) DQ8trans induced stronger responses from IA-2957–972–specific clones
in the presence of 50 and 500 nM peptides. (C) Secretion of IFN- was significantly higher from cross-reactive T cell clones when stimulated with pDQ8trans. Peptide
concentrations used in (C) were as follows: 5 nM (GAD65250–266), 50 nM (IA-2957–972), 2.5 M (InsB11–24), which were the minimal concentrations that cytokine secretion
could be detected for specific clones. Error bars in (A) and (B) represent SDs among three experiments. Comparison of T cell responses to DQ8cis and DQ8trans was evaluated

with the unusual high affinity of cognate TCR as TCR with affinities
beyond the natural range can initiate T cells responses faster than
TCR within the natural range, although both may endow T cells with
the same functional avidity (28).
To assess the contribution of distinct chain residues to altered
T cell functional avidity, a set of DQ8trans mutants in complex with
GAD65250–266 were made in which specific chain residues adjacent
to or within the peptide-binding pockets [namely, 31 and 52 in
pocket 1, 44–50 at the lateral side of pocket 1, and 72–73 in pocket
9 (8, 9)] were replaced with those of DQ8cis (table S4 and Fig. 4,
B and C). The corresponding residues Glu31, Arg52, Ile72, and
Val73 in DQ8cis were Gln31 , a deletion in position 52, Ser72 ,
and Leu73  in DQ8trans (Fig. 4C). We were not able to produce
DQ8trans mutant protein with addition of Arg52  alone (the residue
absent in the pocket 1 of DQ8trans) and had to generate this mutant
protein in combination with other mutations (DQ8trans  Q31E,
 F51_ R53insR, and DQ8trans ∆ 44–50,  W43_ F51insDQ8cis
 44–50,  F51_ R53insR in table S4 and Fig. 4B). T cell functional
avidity was not affected with substitution of  31 or  72–73 (DQ8trans
 Q31E and DQ8trans  S72I,  L73V in table S4 and Fig. 4B) and
was only slightly reduced for GAD65250–266 clone 07-C1 with the
substitution of  44–50 (DQ8trans ∆ 44–50,  W43_ F51insDQ8cis
 44–50 in table S4 and Fig. 4B). Inclusion of Arg52  with  31 or
 44–50 substitutions in DQ8trans, however, significantly reduced
responses of T cell clones to a level similar to that of DQ8cis (table S4
and Fig. 4B). As substitution of either  31 or  44–50 alone had a
minimal effect, these results highlight the importance of inserting
an additional Arg in between Phe51  and Arg53  in DQ8trans
diminishing T cell responses to pDQ8trans. The pivotal role of the
Arg52  residue in the regulation of TCR reactivity was further confirmed by the observation that T cell functional avidity for DQ8cis
was enhanced by replacing the  44–52 domain in DQ8cis with the
corresponding domain from DQ8trans (DQ8cis ∆ 44–50, ∆ 52,
 W43_ F51insDQ8trans  44–50 in table S4 and Fig. 4B). In total,
these data suggest that the presence or the absence of Arg52  in DQA1
chain plays an important role in regulating DQ8cis/trans-restricted
T cell responses.
Altered orientation ofimportant TCR-contact residues
in the bound peptides by the absence of Arg52  residue
inDQA1*0501
Although Arg52  can potentially dictate peptide-binding preference
at pocket 1 (9), the differences in T cell reactivity to pDQ8cis/
pDQ8trans cannot be adequately explained by pMHC affinity as the
shared GAD65250–266 and IA-2957–972 epitopes bound comparably to
both molecules (fig. S4A). Thus, altered T cell avidity by Arg52 
might reflect a differential display of the bounded peptide toward
TCR. This scenario was investigated by in silico modeling analysis.
The side view of the superimposed GAD65251–263 bound by DQ8cis
and DQ8trans revealed almost identical positioning for anchor residues p4Phe, p6Met, p7Phe, and p9Glu (Fig. 5A). However, a slightly
different orientation at the p1Ile anchor led to a considerable divergence at the TCR contact surface, including the important TCR contact residues p3Arg, p5Lys, and p11Lys (Fig. 5A and fig. S3B). A similar
observation was found in the superposition of IA-2957–972, with distinct orientation at potential TCR-contacting p3Leu and p8Glu residues
(Fig. 5A and fig. S3B). Replacement of the  44–50 residues of DQ8trans
with those of DQ8cis and insertion of Arg52  into DQ8trans
(DQ8trans ∆ 44–50,  W43_ F51insDQ8cis  44–50,  F51_ R53insR)
resulted in a nearly matched peptide orientation between DQ8cis
and DQ8trans in the context of GAD65250–266 and IA-2957–972 epitopes
(Fig. 5B), in contrast to little change of peptide orientation in DQ8trans
when only the  44–50 substitutions were in place (DQ8trans ∆ 44–50,
 W43_ F51insDQ8cis  44–50).
The presence or absence of Arg52  was also associated with the
conformation of some MHC residues (fig. S4B), possibly linked to
peptide orientation, that leads to remarkably different modeled interactions with the adjacent, prominent TCR contact residues of
the bound epitopes. In the DQ8cis/GAD65251–263 modeled complex,
p3Arg interacted via hydrogen bonds with the OH group of Thr61 
and the side chain amide group of Asn62  and was away from
Asp55 . p5Lys pointed toward the  chain, interacting via a salt
bridge with Glu74. By contrast, in the DQ8trans/GAD65251–263
modeled complex, p3Arg cannot interact with Thr61  and Asn62  as
they were distantly located. The terminal guanidine group of p3Arg
formed a salt bridge with Asp55  in the DQ8trans complex. p5Lys
pointed upward and away from p3Arg, Arg70, and Glu74; the
latter two residues were closer to each other than in the DQ8cis
modeled complex.
Molecular modeling of InsB12–23, which contains the same register
as InsB11–24, revealed stronger interactions between the p9Arg anchor
of InsB12–23 (InsB22Arg) and surrounding pocket 9 residues of the
DQ8trans compared to that of DQ8cis (Fig. 5C), in addition to a
reorientation of the N and C termini of the insulin peptide in the
groove (Fig. 5A). Besides the interactions observed for both molecules, p9Arg anchor of InsB12–23 formed four hydrogen bonds with
Ser72  of DQ8trans (albeit one of them weak), in contrast to only
weak van der Waals interactions between the p9Arg anchor of
InsB12–23 and Val73  of DQ8cis (table S5). The extra hydrogen bonds
between Arg76  and Ser72  (Fig. 5C and table S5) in the DQ8trans/
InsB12–23 complex, but not in the DQ8cis/InsB12–23 complex,
would further stabilize pocket 9 and potentially contribute to the
stability of the DQ8trans/InsB12–23 complex. Thus, for the nonacidic p9 anchor InsB12–23 epitope, the expanded network of residue
interaction in pocket 9 might enhance accommodation of epitopes
in DQ8trans. Similar to GAD65250–266 and IA-2957–972, substitution
of only  44–50 with the respective residues from DQ8cis (A1*0301)
causes trivial deviations in the orientation of anchor residues p-2 to
p2 and p8 to p10 but hardly any change from anchor residues p3 to
p7. Together, the modeling results suggested that Arg52  residue of
DQ   chain regulates TCR-pDQ8cis/trans intramolecular interactions through reorientation of bound peptides.
DISCUSSION
Although it is well established that DQ8/DQ2 cis and trans molecules
play a pivotal role in T1D, little is known regarding the cognate
islet-epitope repertoire and the interaction between pathogenic T cells
and DQ molecules. In contrast to the notion that DQ8trans increases
susceptibility to T1D by presentation of a unique T cell epitope repertoire, in this study, we discovered a high degree of epitope overlap
and T cell promiscuity between DQ8cis and DQ8trans (Table 1 and
Fig. 1), and cross-reactive T cells from homozygous DQ8 participants
often recognized the trans-complementary molecule (Fig. 2, A and B).
Despite the similarity in epitope recognition and pMHC association (figs. S3B and S4A), increased affinity of TCR-pMHC complexes by distinct amino acid residues at DQ2cis   chain leads to
enhanced functional recognition of T cells to DQ8trans in complex

with immunodominant and disease-relevant GAD65250–266 (Fig. 4),
correlating with the increased risk of T1D of DQ8/DQ2 heterozygosity. Epistatic interaction of HLA genes in other autoimmune
diseases includes shared epitope–containing DRB1 alleles in RA
(29, 30) and DRB1*1501/DRB5*0101 in MS (31) but with undefined or a small number of T cell specificities. Our study provides a
molecular and functional basis whereby disease risk may be altered
primarily by increased T cell promiscuity driven by HLA epistatic
interaction.
Our data suggest a promiscuous but nondegenerate TCR-peptideDQ8cis/trans interaction, in which the pMHC/TCR affinity/avidity
is governed mainly by the presence or absence of the potential nonTCR contact residue DQ Arg52  (8, 9) within the peptide-binding
cleft. T cell cross-reactivity can occur by preservation of structural
similarity at specific TCR-pMHC contact sites without the need for
TCR degeneracy. In cross-recognition of pDQ8cis and pDQ8trans,
the differences in the pDQ8cis/trans   chain are distal to or within
the peptide-binding cleft (8, 9) and do not overlap with TCR footprints of canonical docking (9). The increased 2D affinity and functional avidity for DQ8trans/GAD65250–266 (Fig. 4) cannot be attributed
to GAD65250–266 affinity for MHC (fig. S4A). Thus, TCR discrimination
of DQ8cis/trans-GAD65250–266 complexes must involve differences
in peptide or MHCII conformation. Distinct peptide orientation
patterns at critical TCR contact residues and distinct conformations
of several conserved   chain residues at the TCR/pMHCII interface,
due to the presence or absence of DQ Arg52 , were seen in the
modeled structures of DQ8cis and DQ8trans in complex with
GAD65250–266 (Fig. 5, A and B). DQ  52-mediated peptide reorientation was also observed in the context of two other disease-relevant
InsB11–23 and IA-2957–972 epitopes (Fig. 5, A and B), implying a common
architecture for TCR recognition of both DQ8cis and DQ8transrestricted islet epitopes. In contrast to the narrowed TCR usage in
cross-reactive, gliadin-specific T cell clones (9, 32), TCR usage in
cross-reactive, GAD65250–266-specific T cell clones was quite diverse
(fig. S5A). The divergent TCR repertoire suggests an unconfined
flexible TCR docking zone enabling the promiscuous TCR discrimination of pDQ8cis/trans complexes.
The T cell clones generated in this study were tetramer-positive
and would likely have high affinity for their respective pMHC molecules. In general, we have found tetramers to require 2D affinity values of 10−4 to 10−5 m4
 for their avidity reaction (33). The highly
sensitive 2D micropipette assay confirmed their high affinity (10−3 m4
)
yet was still able to discern significant affinity differences between
the DQ8cis and DQ8trans that directly connect to the functional
responses. It should be noted that twofold differences in affinity can
lead to major functional and fate decisions including differentiation
and tissue trafficking of T follicular helper cells (34). Thus, we demonstrate that not only all clones tested are all of high affinity but also,
when comparing DQ8cis to DQ8trans, the pMHC with the highest
2D affinity correlates with the most effective T cell response and subsequent susceptibility to T1D (Figs. 3A and 4A).
T cell clones derived by DQ8cis or DQ8trans tetramer were
only activated by pDQ8cis and pDQ8trans but not by pDQ2cis or
pDQ2trans (fig. S5B), raising the possibility that the shared  chain
is more critical to T cell recognition. The dominance of one MHC
chain in T cell recognition has been observed for myelin basic protein
peptide–specific T cells, including the highly cross-reactive Hy.1B11
(35–37). The few available crystal structures of autoimmune TCRs
in complex with their specific pMHCIIs typically exhibit an extremely
focused and narrow peptide footprint (35–37). However, our T cell
reactivity profiles for GAD65250–266, InsB11–23, and IA-2957–972 suggest
that specific T cells recognized these epitopes across the entire peptide
region (fig. S3B), arguing against the case of unconventional TCR
docking for these epitopes.
The enhanced functional recognition via pDQ8trans of immunodominant GAD65250–266- and IA-2957–972–specific T cells at the molecular level (Fig. 3) did not lead to significantly higher frequencies
of specific T cells in DQ8+
DQ2+
 patients, compared to DQ8+
DQ2−
patients (Fig. 2, C and D), and phenotypically, most GAD65250–266-
and IA-2957–972–specific T cells demonstrated a T helper 1–like phenotype
(table S3). A number of homeostatic properties could be involved in
control of T cell numbers, e.g., proliferation of these disease-related
cells in participants with T1D could be influenced by the suppressive
immune responses from other T cells, an anergic state of islet-specific
memory cells (38) might well keep the majority of cross-reactive cells
in quiescence, or differences in surface expression of DQ molecules
could impact susceptibility to T1D (39). Thus, at the cellular level,
the role of DQ8trans in islet autoimmunity may be an active component of the dynamic temporal nature of the autoimmune process (40, 41).
It has been suggested that the absence of aspartic acid residues at
57 in DQ8/DQ2 cis and trans molecules leads to a highly skewed
peptide repertoire favoring a negative charge at the p9 anchor (10–12).
Our T cell epitope data agreed with these previous reports as more
than 90% epitopes identified in this study have a negative charge at the
C-terminal end. In contrast, two influenza antigen–derived epitopes
with a nonacidic p9 anchor residue (HA186–202 and NP175–191) were
identified in this study, and both of them bound to DQ8cis/trans
with a moderate affinity (fig. S4A). Recently, an oncogenic self-peptide
with an atypical DQ8cis/trans-binding motif was found to be restricted
by DQ8cis (42). These observations highlight the presence and importance of atypical DQ8cis/trans-binding epitopes in immune responses to foreign and self-antigens. Therefore, identification of
T cells specific for atypical DQ8cis/trans-binding epitopes might
further advance the understanding of DQ8cis/trans-specific T cell
repertoire and their implication in progression of T1D.
In summary, the promiscuous TCR/pMHCII interactions reported in
this study provide functional and structural insights into TCR recognition of T1D–associated DQ8cis/trans complexes. The reported
mechanism is distinct from selective presentation of autoimmune
peptides or altered T cell repertoires as the primary drivers of autoimmune pathology. The increased risk of T1D in DQ8/DQ2 heterozygous individuals is attributable, in part, to epistatic interactions
between HLA alleles that lead to promiscuous TCR recognition of
pDQ8cis and pDQ8trans, with amplified functional responses to
the latter. The exquisite discrimination of these two molecules in
complex with islet-derived epitopes by TCR results from modest
differences in the   chain at the N-terminal end of the pocket binding cleft. The mode of TCR discrimination to DQ8cis/trans complexes reported in this study is likely to be shared by other DQ8cis/
trans-restricted islet epitopes. Thus, the structural and functional
characteristics of genetically linked T cell promiscuity demonstrated
in this study may be important for the immunopathology and
immunomodulation of T1D. Arg52  is not surface exposed, but
its presence may serve as a functional switch while preserving the
structural similarity at specific TCR-pMHC contact sites without
much change in the pMHC conformation. Modulation of TCR/
pDQ8cis/trans affinities via mutagenesis at Arg52  may lead to more

effective induction of anergy/apoptosis or conversion of naïve lowavidity autoreactive T cells into memory-like autoregulatory cells,
e.g., by gene editing or nanoparticle-based immunotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
These studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board of
Benaroya Research Institute (BRI, Seattle, WA) and Seattle Children’s
Hospital. All DQ8+
DQ2−
 and DQ8+
DQ2+
 participants were volunteers
of Caucasian descent and were recruited with written consent from
participating individuals or assent and the consent of their guardians
if participants were minors (tables S2 and S3). HLA typing was conducted by the BRI sequencing and genotyping core facilities. Autoantibodies were measured at the Barbara Davis Center for Childhood
Diabetes.
HLA-DQ proteins and tetramers
Recombinant DQ8cis, DQ2cis, DQ8trans, and mutated DQ8cis/
trans proteins were produced as previously described (20). Briefly,
soluble DQ proteins were purified from insect cell culture supernatants by affinity chromatography. For the preparation of HLA class II
tetramers, DQ proteins were in vivo biotinylated in Drosophila S2
cells before harvest and exchanged to citric/phosphate buffer (pH 5.4)
(or to phosphate-buffered saline for covalent pDQ8cis or pDQ8trans
complexes). The biotinylated monomer was loaded with peptide
(0.2 mg/ml) by incubating at 37°C for 72 hours in the presence of
n-dodecyl--maltoside (0.2 mg/ml) and 1 mM Pefabloc SC (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO). Peptide-loaded monomers were subsequently
conjugated into tetramers using R-PE (phycoerythrin)–streptavidin
(Biosource International, Camarillo, CA) at a molar ratio of 8:1.
The quality control of DQ monomers, empty or covalently linked
with GAD65250–266, was carried out by staining T cell clones with
serially diluted DQ tetramers.
Selection ofislet-specific peptides and peptides synthesis
Multiple T1D-associated islet antigens, IA-2, ICA69, Phogrin, and
Zn T8, were screened using the DQ8cis binding prediction algorithm
in NetMHCIIpan (43) to identify potential DQ8cis/trans-restricted
peptides. The top 20 to 25 ranking peptides for each protein were
selected for T cell experiments. IGRP-specific epitopes was identified directly by Tetramer Guided Epitope Mapping. Peptides derived
from influenza antigens, islet antigens, and a panel of modified
GAD65250–266, InsB11–24, and IA-2957–972 peptides with alanine,
glycine, or phenylalanine substitution were synthesized by Mimotopes
(Clayton, Australia).
Tetramer-guided epitope identification
PBMCs were prepared from the blood of T1D participants or
healthy participants by Ficoll underlay. CD4+
 T cells were isolated
using the Miltenyi CD4+
 T cell isolation kit, plated in 48-well plates
with adherent antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and stimulated with
the selected islet-peptide set or a pool of five consecutive peptides of
17 amino acids in length with an 11-residue overlap spanning the
H1HA and H1NP protein sequences. The cells were cultured for
2 weeks in the presence of T cell medium and IL-2 (Roche; added
every 24 to 48 hours starting on day 7) at 37°C and stained with PE
tetramers. Subsequently, cells were stained with CD4 PerCP (BD
Biosciences), CD3 FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate), and CD25 APC
monoclonal antibodies (eBioscience) and analyzed by flow cytometry.
Cells from pools that gave positive staining were analyzed again
with the corresponding individual peptide tetramers to identify each
antigenic peptide. Our criterion for positivity was distinct staining
that labeled a compact tetramer-positive CD4+
 population and was
more than threefold above background (cells from an unstimulated
well) in the same experiment.
T cell clone isolation
T cell clones were generated by staining cultured T cells with tetramers, sorting gated tetramer-positive CD4+
 cells using FACSAria
(at single-cell purity, applying a singlet gate to the lymphocyte population), and expanding in a 96-well plate in the presence of 1.0 × 105
irradiated PBMCs and phytohemagglutinin (2 g/ml; Remel Inc.,
Lenexa, KS). After expansion of each T cell clone into a single well of
a 48-well plate, clones were stained again with tetramer and also
stimulated in parallel with the corresponding peptides (500 nM),
adding HLA-DQ–matched irradiated PBMCs as APCs and measuring
thymidine uptake to verify epitope specificity.
T cell proliferation, cytokine enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay, and half-maximal effective
concentration determination
Proliferation assays were performed in triplicate in 96-well roundbottom plates. T cell clones were stimulated with irrelevant or specific
peptides in the presence of irradiated nontransfected or DQ-transfected
HEK293 cells as APCs. After 72-hour stimulation, cultures were
pulsed with 1 Ci of [3
H] thymidine and harvested 18 hours later. SI
was calculated by dividing the net counts of specific peptides (counts
per minute of DQ8cis- or DQ8trans-stimulated cells subtracted from
counts per minute of nontransfected cells) by the counts per minute
of irrelevant peptide. For cytokine enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA), IFN- (clone MD-1), IL-4 (clone 8D4–8), and IL-10
(clone JES3-19F1) capturing antibodies (BioLegend) were coated
onto 96-well round-bottom plates. Supernatants (50 l) from cultures
of T cell clones were collected after 48 hours of stimulation and
added to each well. After overnight incubation, bound cytokines
were detected by biotinylated anti–IFN- (clone 4 s.B3), anti–IL-4
(clone MP4-25D2), and anti–IL-10 (clone JES3-12G8) antibodies
(BioLegend) and quantified using a Victor2 D time-resolved fluorometer (PerkinElmer). Unless otherwise stated, peptide concentrations were everywhere 2.5 M for the wild-type insulin peptide and
500 nM for all other peptides. For half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) determination in Fig. 4B, secreted IFN- was measured
by ELISA after co-incubation of T cell clones with serial-diluted
mutated DQ8cis/trans proteins for 48 hours. For EC50 determination
in fig. S4A, various concentrations of each biotinylated peptide
were incubated in wells coated with DQ8 and DQ8trans proteins.
After washing, the remaining biotinylated peptides were labeled
using europium-conjugated streptavidin (PerkinElmer) and quantified using the Victor2 D time-resolved fluorometer (PerkinElmer).
EC50 values were calculated via a nonlinear regression model in
Prism software. All experiments except EC50 determination in fig.
S4A were performed in the presence of anti-CD28 antibodies (1 g/ml).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with Prism software (GraphPad
Software Inc.). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by
Bonferroni’s test was used to perform multigroup comparisons of

T cell frequency. An unpaired or paired t test was used to compare
the T cell responses between pDQ8cis and pDQ8trans. The extra
sum-of-squares F test was used to compare EC50 between different
DQ8cis/trans proteins.
Binding motif determination forGAD65250–266, InsB11–24,
and IA-2957–972
A panel of 17 GAD65250–266-, 13 InsB11–24-, and 16 IA-2957–972–derived
peptides with a single alanine substitution was synthesized to determine the antigenic motif. Glycine or phenylalanine substitution was
used if the original residue was an alanine. GAD65250–266, InsB11–24,
and IA-2957–972 T cell clones obtained from T1D patients were stimulated with 500 nM (for GAD65250–266 and IA-2957–972) or 2.5 M (for
InsB11–24) of wild-type or modified peptides in the presence of irradiated DQ8cis- or DQ8trans-expressing HEK293 cells as APCs. For
GAD65250–266 and IA-2957–972, cultures were pulsed after 72 hours of
stimulation with 1 Ci of [3
H] thymidine and harvested 18 hours
later. For InsB11–24, culture supernatants were collected after 48 hours
of stimulation and assayed for IFN- secretion by cytokine ELISA.
The % activity was calculated by dividing the SI of mutated peptides
by the SI of the wild-type peptide. All stimulation experiments were
performed in the presence of anti-CD28 antibodies (1 g/ml).
Ex vivo analysis ofislet-specific T cells
Thirty million PBMCs in culture medium at a concentration of
150 million/ml were incubated with 50 nM dasatinib for 10 min at 37°C.
The cells were next stained with 250 nM PE-labeled tetramers at
room temperature for 120 min, followed by antibody staining for
20 min at 4°C with CD4 APC (clone RPA-T4, eBioscience), CD45RO
FITC (clone UCHC1, eBioscience), and a combination of CD14
PerCP (clone MφP9, BD Pharmingen) and CD19 PerCP (clone
SJ25C1, BD Pharmingen) to exclude B cells and monocytes from
the analysis. Cells were washed twice and incubated with anti-PE
magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) at
4°C for another 20 min. The cells were washed again and enriched with
a Miltenyi magnetic column. Samples were labeled with ViaProbe
(BD Biosciences) and analyzed on a BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer.
Frequencies were calculated by dividing the number of tetramerpositive cells in the bound fraction by the number of total CD4+
T cells in the sample. For ex vivo costaining of GAD65250–266-specific
cells with DQ8cis and DQ8trans tetramers, PBMCs from DQ8+
DQ2−
participants were first stained with PE-labeled DQ8trans/GAD65250–266
tetramers. After enrichment, tetramer-positive cells were stained again
with APC-labeled DQ8cis/GAD65250–266 tetramers at 37°C for 1 hour.
2D micropipette adhesion frequency assay
The 2D affinity of cultured HLA-DQ CD4+
 T cell clones specific for
DQ8cis (DQA1*0301/DQB1*0302) and DQ8trans (DQA1*0501/
DQB1*0302) were measured using the previously characterized 2D
micropipette adhesion frequency assay (33). Briefly, red blood cells
(RBCs) were coated with Biotin-LC-NHS (BioVision), followed by
streptavidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and with either covalently
linked, biotinylated DQ8cis/GAD65250–266 or DQ8trans/GAD65250–266
monomers. In this 2D assay, the adhesion frequency between TCR
on the T cell and ligand (pMHC on an RBC) aspirated on opposing
pipettes was observed using an inverted microscope. An electronically controlled piezoelectric actuator repeated 50 T cell contact and
separation cycles with the pMHC-coated RBC while keeping time
(t) constant. Following retraction of the T cell, adhesion (binding of
TCR:pMHC) was observed as distention of the RBC membrane,
allowing for quantification of the adhesion frequency (Pa). Surface
pMHC (ml) ligand and TCR (mr) densities were determined by flow
cytometry and BD QuantiBRITE PE beads for standardization (BD
Biosciences). The calculation of molecules per area was determined
by dividing the number of TCRs and pMHCs per cell by the respective
surface areas. The relative 2D affinities were calculated using the
following equation: AcKa = −ln [1 − Pa (1)]/mrml. Normalized adhesion frequency was calculated using the equation [−ln(1 − Pa(s))/ml
(pMHC)]. Geometric means of all measured single-cell affinities are
reported ± SEM.
Molecular modeling
Models of DQ8cis and DQ8trans in complex with GAD65251–263,
InsB12–23, and IA-2959–971, using the antigenic motifs shown in fig. S3,
were prepared on a Silicon Graphics Fuel workstation using the
program Discover, version 2005 (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) as previous
reported (12, 15, 24). Briefly, the basis molecule for pDQ8cis complexes was the DQ8cis-InsB11–23 complex, without any solvent
molecules [(8); pdb code: 1jk8]. To generate pDQ8trans complexes,
we superimposed the DQ2cis-  gliadin complex (pdb code: 1s9v;
also used free of solvent) onto this DQ8cis-InsB11–23 complex, as
previously described (12, 24). The subsequent availability of the
crystal structure of a DQ8trans molecule complexed with a gluten
peptide and the cognate TCR (9) allowed us to compare the soobtained model pDQ8trans structure with its crystal counterpart.
The root mean square deviation in the alpha carbons (C s) of the two
structures was very small, both in the histocompatibility molecules
and the bound antigenic peptides, confirming the validity of the
approach. In the case of molecular simulation of mutated DQ8trans
structures containing the Arg52  insertion, the DQ8-InsB11–23 crystal
structure above was used as the base molecular complex (8). We
assumed that the amino acid deletion in the HLA-DQ2   chain occurs
at position 52, as this results in the least deviation from structural
equivalence of neighboring residues among DQ molecules with this
deletion and those without [e.g., Arg53 , as evidenced by all the
crystal structures of DQ8cis, DQ2cis, and DQ8trans (9)]. Amino acid
substitutions both in the antigenic peptide and the  MHCII molecules were performed manually by selecting from a library of available
rotamers of the software to arrive at residues with orientations consistent with the environment in which they were placed. Molecular
simulation was performed via energy minimization, as previously
described (12, 15, 24), at a physiological pH of 7.4. Minimization
proceeded by one thousand steps of the steepest gradient approach,
followed by another thousand steps of the conjugated gradient
approach, as previously described (12, 15). Figures were drawn with
the aid of WebLab Viewer version 3.5 and DS Viewer Pro version
6.0 (both from Accelrys, San Diego, CA). The .pdb coordinates of
the pDQ8cis/trans complexes shown and discussed here will be
available to interested researchers upon request to A.K.M. or G.K.P.
