Abstract. UTI is an infection that occurs in the urinary tract due to the proliferation of a
microorganism. Female is fourteen times more vulnerable to UTI than male, because their
urethra is shorter. Bladder epithelium is coated with a thin layer of glycosaminoglycans which
act as a non-specific anti-adherence factor and nonspecific defense mechanisms against
infection and can be found in the urine. An analytic study with cross sectional approach was
conducted in 46 patients (23 with UTI and 23 non UTI) from June 2016 to determine
differences in levels of urinary glycosaminoglycans between two groups. Urine samples were
taken and tested for UTI and non UTI strips test. Laboratory examination of urine GAGs levels
using ELISA kit for Human Glycosaminoglycans, then tabulated and analyzed using SPSS.
The result showed no significant differences in the characteristics of women between two
groups. There are significant differences in the mean levels of urinary GAGs in women with
UTI compared with Non-UTI (69.74 ± 21.34; 21.39 ± 2.61 mg/l; p <0.001). There was no
significant relationship between the sexual status and UTI incidence, with low odds ratio
values and no significant difference in the mean of urinary glicosaminoglycans level based on
sexual status.
1. Introduction
Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is an infectious disease commonly found in all age groups. But, some
groups of people are more prone to UTIs than others. UTI is broadly defined as an inflammatory
response against bacterial invasion of the urothelium, which usually associated with bacteriuria and
pyuria. Bacteriuria is the presence of bacteria in the urine. UTI can happen anywhere along the urinary
tract. Women are fourteen times more prone to suffer from UTI than men. UTIs are more common in
women who are sexually active and after menopause.[1,2]
Strong evidence was found that among infectious diseases in the urinary tract such as UTI, cystitis
and painful bladder syndrome, interstitial cystitis that pathophysiology associated with the early stages
of the disease lose the mucus layer of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which is the beginning of the
inflammatory process. Bladder epithelium is coated with a thin layer of GAGs that act as non-specific
anti-adherence factors and non-specific defense mechanism against infection and can be found in the
urine. Injured and not healed GAGs layers can cause bladder epithelial damage and chronic
neurogenic inflammation.[3]

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Location, time and population
This was a cross-sectional study to know the difference of GAGs in patients with Urinary Tract
Infections (UTI) and non-Urinary Tract Infection (Non-UTI). The research was conducted in RSUP H.
Adam Malik,and RSU Pirngadi Medan from June 2016 until the number of samples was fulfilled.The
populations were all inpatient and outpatient women in RSUP Dr. H. Adam Malik and RSU Pirngadi
Medan, with Urinary Tract Infection as a diagnosis or complaint.The samples were part of the
population whom GAGs levels were measured. Samples were chosen by using a randomized sampling
technique based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
2.2. Data collection
After having anexplanation of the research purpose, benefits, procedures, and signed agreement to
participate, interviews were conducted by using questionnaires to determine the researcher required
data. As much as 20cc mid-stream urine was taken from theparticipant for urine test strips UTI and
non-UTI, then levels of GAGs were measured by using ELISA kit for Human Glycosaminoglycan
(GAGs), which will be examined in the laboratory. Data were collected and analyzed statistically.
2.3. Ethics
Ethical clearance was approved by Ethical Committee of Medical Faculty, Universitas Sumatera
Utara. Informed consents were obtained from all test participants.
2.4. Data analysis
Data analysis and statistical tests were computerized. The results of the research will be presented in
frequency distribution table. To analyze the differences in the levels of GAGs, astatistical testwas
conducted with unpaired t-test for normal distribution data. If the data were not normally distributed,
Mann-Whitney test would be conducted with a confidence level of 95% (α = 0.05).
3. Results
Based on table 1, the characteristics of research subjects based on age in the UTI women group were
mostly at the age of 26-30 years (56.5%) whereas in the Non-UTI group,mostwere at the age of 20-25
years (56.5%). By education level, UTI women group were mostly low-educated (56.5%) as well as in
Non-UTI group (52.2%). Based on sexual status, the UTI women group were most sexually active
(73.9%) as well as in Non-UTI group (60.9%). Based on employment, the samples in UTI women
group are mostly employed (52.2%) whereas in the Non-UTI group,most are unemployed (65.2%).
Based on the statistical test by Chi-Square test, there were no significant differences between the UTI
women characteristics with non-UTI women characteristics (p>0.05).

aChi-Square test
From table 2, it was found that the level of urine glycosaminoglycans was not normally distributed,
so that the Mann-Whitney test was conducted to determine the differences between the mean of urine
glycosaminoglycanslevel on women with UTI and Non-UTI. The mean of urine glycosaminoglycans
level on women with UTI was 69.74 ± 21.34 mg/l the mean of urine glycosaminoglycans level on
women with non-UTI was 21.39 ± 2.61 mg/l. Statistically, there was a significant difference on the
mean of urine glycosaminoglycans level on women with UTI and Non-UTI. The hypothesis of this
research, which stated that there were significant differences in urine glycosaminoglycans level on
women with Urinary Tract Infection and Non-Urinary Tract Infection, is accepted.

As shown in table 3, Chi-square test was conducted to determine the relationship between sexual
statuses with UTI incidence. Based on statistical analysis by chi-square test, there was no significant
relationship between sexual statuses with UTI incidence (p<0.345). From the table, it was known that
the odds ratio value was 1,821. It meant that a patient with sexually active status has the possibility to
suffer UTI by 1.8 times.

4. Discussion
The results of this research found no significant difference between the UTI women characteristics
with non-UTI women characteristics (p>0.05). This explains that characteristics of age, education
level, sex, and employment status have no influence on levels of GAGs. The literature states that UTIs
are more often found in women who are sexually active and after menopause. In this research, the
women were still in theproductive and premenopausal state.
Protective factors that counter UTI in women is the estrogen-dependent mucous membranes
formation of GAGs in the bladder. This mucus has a function as an antimicrobial. During menopause,
estrogen levels decline, and this protection system disappeared so that women who had experienced
menopause will be prone to UTI. Protection against UTI isformed by the urine nature which is acidic
and then acts as an antibacterial. Bladder epithelial layer also serves as adefense mechanism against
infection. This layer also specifically regulate bladder function and contribute to the pathogenesis of
various bladder diseases.[3,4,5]
Results of laboratory analysis of the urinary GAGs levels showed that the mean GAGs level of
women with UTI group was 69.74 ± 21.34 mg/l. It was higher than the mean GAGs level in women
with Non-UTI group (21.39 ± 2.61 mg/l). Statistical test showed a significant difference between the
mean levels of GAGs in women with UTI and non-UTI groups. This explains the GAGs level was
significantly increased in the urine of women with urinary tract infections.
The bladder has avariety of natural defense mechanism against infection. Bacteria are taken out by
the bladder through the urine. Low urine pH inhibits the bacteria growth. Urothelium also maintains
bladder from infection by recognizing and preventing bacteria adhesion. GAGs layer, umbrella cells,
tight junctions, which covers the top layer of the urothelium, form the highly impermeable epithelial
surface. GAGs have a role in the immune system stimulation by triggering the activation and
leukocytes movement to inflammatory tissue. GAGs also act as chemokines carrier and growth
factors.[6,7]
GAGs layer also known as the mucosal layer, is an important factor in cellular permeability. It is
composed of GAGs layer and proteoglycans which cover thesurface of the lumen urothelium. Damage
to this layer causes urothelial cells exposure which is located in the base and may cause bladder
dysfunction.[6]
The same research results reported by George Gray, who conducted research on 662 samples and
found increased levels of GAGs in 14 samples.[9]
In the Le PhucThuy and colleagues research, thenormal value of total urinary GAGs in adults is 1.8
± 0.6 g / mol creatinine with 16 people samples.[10]
David C. Wei conducted research for measurement of GAGs in 20 normal individuals and 25
patients with UTI, then found the levels of GAGs in normal individuals is 19.9 ± 2.5, and the GAGs
levels in patients with UTI is 30.4 ± 5.1.[11]
While Gousse A et al., who conducted research on 14 patients with UTI and 4 normal individuals,
found GAGs levels in normal individuals are 39.5 ± 11.2 μg/mg Cr, while the GAGs levels in apatient
with UTI are 75 ± 15.4 μg/mg Cr. Yara et al. conducted a measurement of GAGs in 25 normal
individuals where they found the levels of GAGs are 20.16 – 22.50 mg/L.[12]
5. Conclusion
Statistically, there was no significant difference found between UTI women characteristics and nonUTI women characteristics (p>0.05). The difference in mean levels of urinary glycosaminoglycans
was statistically significant in UTI women than in non-UTI women.

There was no significant relationship between the sexual status and UTI incidence (p>0.05), with
low odds ratio values and no significant difference in the mean of urinary glycosaminoglycans level
based on sexual status.
