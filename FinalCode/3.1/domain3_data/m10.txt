Detoxifying effects of ultrafiltration fractions of
Dendrobium aphyllum peptides on chemical and
AAPH-induced oxidative stress†
Huifan Liu, Juanjuan Ma and Hui Wu *
Antioxidative peptides were extracted from Dendrobium aphyllum. The Lactobacillus strain was identified as
Lactobacillus amylolyticus L6. Analysis of amino acid composition and HPLC-MS/MS analysis indicated
a high antioxidative potential of the low molecular weight DA-P fractions which contained 21 different
types of polypeptides. DA-P exhibited antioxidative abilities and the DA-P fraction with a size less than 1
kDa displayed optimal activity, as determined through DPPH and ABTS free radical scavenging assays and
the reducing power assay. Human erythrocytes subjected to an 2,20
-azobis[2-methylpropionamidine]
dihydrochloride (AAPH)-induced hemolysis assay using the DA-P fraction with the size below 1 kDa
quenched the intracellular antioxidant system by inhibiting the generation of reactive oxygen species and
malondialdehyde and regulating the activity of cellular antioxidative enzymes, including superoxide
dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. These results provide valuable information for the use
of Dendrobium aphyllum as a functional food for Lactobacillus sp.
1 Introduction
Peptides are specic small, inactive protein fragments that have
the same sequences as their functional proteins.1 In general,
peptides comprise 2–20 amino acids and have biological activities that depend on their chain length, amino acid composition, and sequence.2 The favorable biological activities of
peptides include antioxidant, anti-hypertensive, anti-obesity,
anticancer, and angiotensin-converting inhibitor activities.3 It
has been reported that the proportion of hydrophobic groups
and aromatic residues in peptides are correlated with their
antioxidant activity.4,5 For example, the side-chain groups of
amino acids such as imidazole in histidine, indolic groups in
tryptophan, and phenolic groups in tyrosine have been reported
to contribute to the antioxidant activity of peptides.2
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are constantly generated
during normal physiological reactions, e.g., defending against
infections.6 Under conditions of excess ROS or dysfunctions in
intrinsic defenses, oxidative stress occurs, leading to protein
malformation, DNA damage, membrane phospholipid peroxidation, low-density lipoprotein modication, and aging-related
problems, among other issues.7,8 Inherent cellular defense
systems consist of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants
that maintain the balance between ROS production and
destruction.6 Peptides acting as antioxidants can mediate
oxidation, including serving as free radical scavengers to
directly quench singlet oxygen, chelating metals, synergistic
interactions with primary antioxidants, and serving as antioxidative secondary compounds produced by peptides that
react with oxidized lipids.9 Currently, synthetic antioxidants are
effective but exhibit potential health risks following long-term
use.10 However, natural antioxidants derived from bioactive
peptides are easily absorbed because of their low molecular
weight; these molecules also show high activity, are inexpensive, and are considered safe.11 Methods such as in vitro
gastrointestinal chemical digestion, enzymatic hydrolysis, and
microbial fermentation can be used to release bioactive
peptides from proteins. Compared to digestion and hydrolysis,
fermentation is less costly and more eco-friendly and thus is
widely used.12 In addition, during fermentation, microorganisms can metabolize large molecules in protein sources into
smaller ones to elevate the concentration of bioactive components to reduce antinutritional factors and benet health.
Traditional assays for measuring antioxidant capacity are based
on chemical reactions that cannot assess toxicity, bioavailability,
and antioxidant component metabolites. In vitro measurement
does not consider in vivo situations, such as stability and tissue
storage.13,14 The use of cell models is a newly developed approach
for quantifying the antioxidant capability of bioactive compounds
in cell culture, while an AAPH-induced erythrocyte hemolysis assay
is used to evaluate AAPH activity as a free radical.15 Erythrocytes,
which lack a nucleus, produce necessary cofactors through
a metabolic network containing 39 metabolites and involving 32

internal metabolic reactions to defend against oxidative stress and
maintain osmotic balance.16,17 Under oxidative stress, loss of
erythrocyte membrane integrity is caused by lipid peroxidation
with peroxyl radicals.18 The characteristics of the peptide-mediated
detoxication during AAPH-induced erythrocyte hemolysis can be
studied by determining the activities of enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase
(CAT) in an enzymatic system, as well as ROS levels, including
monodialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), and glutathione
disulde (GSSG), in a non-enzymatic system.15
Plants of the genus Dendrobium, the second largest genus in
the Orchidaceae family, are mainly found in tropical and
subtropical Asia, Australia, and the Pacic islands and have been
used as a source of food and medicine for thousands of years.19
Members of this genus contain polysaccharides, proteins, and
alkaloids, which have been reported to display anti-cancer,
antidiabetic, immunostimulatory, and antioxidative effects.20,21
Dendrobium aphyllum is widely cultivated in China, particularly
the Yunnan province, because of its low land demand and
remarkable commercial value as a functional food source.
However, few studies have examined its bioactive compounds.
In this study, we evaluated the presence of antioxidative
peptides derived from D. aphyllum, veried their antioxidative
properties, and explored the underlying mechanism through
chemical assays and an AAPH-induced human erythrocyte
hemolysis assay.
2 Materials and methods
2.1 Materials
Dendrobium aphyllum samples were collected from the GAP
farm located in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan province, China.
These samples were authenticated by experts from the Department of Life Science, South China Agricultural University. Eight
strains of Lactobacillus namely Lactobacillus harbinensis (m1),
Lactobacillus mucosae 1 (m2), Lactobacillus fermentum 1 (m4),
Lactobacillus casei (m8), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (C1), Lactobacillus amylolyticus 5 (L5), Lactobacillus amylolyticus 6 (L6), and
Lactobacillus acidophilus (mfm) were obtained from the laboratory of Food Science and Engineering, South China University of
Technology. Ultraltration cassettes with 1, 3, and 5 kDa
molecular weight cut-off sizes were obtained from Millipore
Corp (Billerica, MA, USA). Human blood samples were collected
from three healthy adult volunteers. Casein, Folin reagent, trichloroacetic acid (TCA), vitamin C (VC), AAPH, DPPH, and ABTS
were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).
Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) was purchased from
Gibco Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY, USA). Kits to
determine the activity of SOD, GSH-peroxidase (GSH-PX), CAT,
ROS, MDA, GSSG, and GSH were purchased from Beyotime
Institute of Biotechnology (Shanghai, China). Other reagents
used were of analytical grade.
2.2 Sample preparation
The dried stems of D. aphyllum were crushed into a powder with
a tissue triturator and passed through a 60-mesh screen. Ten
grams of collected sample powder was decolorized and watersoluble impurities were removed using 200 mL 80% ethanol
by rotating distillation for 4 h, followed by washing with 100 mL
95% ethanol, 100 mL anhydrous ethanol, and 50 mL anhydrous
acetone individually by suction ltration with double lter
papers. The D. aphyllum powder was dried at 60 C and stored at
20 C until further use.
2.2.1 Selection of Lactobacillus for D. aphyllum solid-state
fermentation. A total of 8 Lactobacillus strains were evaluated
during solid-state fermentation. Ten grams of dried D. aphyllum
powder was wetted with ultrapure water to maintain 50%
moisture content and sterilization at 121 C for 20 min in an
autoclave. The sterile sample was inoculated (10% inoculum
size) and placed in an incubator at 37 C for 48 h. Aer
fermentation, the sample was dried at 60 C in an oven and
stored at 20 C. The detailed process of D. aphyllum peptide
(DA-P) extraction is described in 2.2.4. Peptide content was
measured using Lowry's method.22 DA-P yield helped determine
whether fermentation by the Lactobacillus strain was satisfactory. The peptide extracted without microbial fermentation was
used as a control. Each sample was evaluated in triplicate.
2.2.2 Determination of protease activity during solid-state
fermentation. Protease activity was evaluated to determine the
dynamic growth pattern of Lactobacillus during fermentation,
using the Folin-phenol method of Chinese Standard GB/T
23527-2009 with casein as a substrate. The pH values of acid
proteinase, neutral proteinase, and alkaline proteinase buffer
solutions were 3.6, 7.5, and 11, respectively. The reaction was
carried out with 1 mL enzyme diluent and 1 mL 2% casein for
10 min at 40 C and then 2 mL 0.4 M TCA was added to
terminate the reaction for 20 min. Aer centrifugation (1000 
g, 10 min), a reaction system containing 1 mL supernatant, 5 mL
0.4 M Na2CO3, and 1 mL Folin reagent was prepared and the
absorbance was determined at 680 nm. One unit of enzyme
activity was dened as the enzyme content in 1 mL enzyme
solution, which produced 1 mg tyrosine by hydrolyzing casein
for 1 min at 40 C. Each sample was evaluated in triplicate.
2.2.3 Optimization of D. aphyllum fermentation conditions by RSM. Single-factor experiments were designed to
determine critical factors affecting the extraction yield of DA-P
aer Lactobacillus solid-state fermentation from D. aphyllum.
Four parameters were analyzed, namely fermentation temperature, fermentation time, moisture content, and Lactobacillus
inoculum size. Based on the results of single-factor experiments, three critical factors were selected for the design of the
response surface experiment, using statistical soware. A Box–
Behnken design with three factorial points, three levels, and
three central points, leading to 15 sets of experiments, was
implemented to determine the optimal fermentation conditions for DA-P.23 The detailed fermented process is described in
2.2.1 and the detailed extraction process of DA-P is described in
2.2.4. Each sample was evaluated in triplicate.
2.2.4 Exaction of DA-P aer fermentation optimization.
Based on the results of the response surface experiment, 10 g D.
aphyllum powder was fermented by following the procedure
under optimized conditions and 1 g of well-fermented sample
was then weighed accurately. DA-P was extracted under the

following conditions: ratio of material to solvent, 1 : 20;
extraction temperature, 37 C; extraction time, 1 h. The peptide
sample was then lyophilized and stored at 20 C until further
use.
2.3 SDS-PAG
SDS-PAGE was conducted as described by Abeyrathne24 with
minor modications. The DA-P sample with or without
fermentation was mixed with sample buffer containing b-mercaptoethanol (ratio of material to solvent, 1 : 1). The sample was
heated at 95 C in a water bath for 5 min and the supernatant
was obtained aer centrifugation (1000  g for 10 min).
Discontinuous vertical plate gel electrophoresis was conducted
using a 12% resolving gel and 5% stacking gel. Further, 20 mL
supernatant sample solution and standard proteins were added
to the corresponding wells in the stacking gel. For the sample in
the stacking gel, a constant voltage of 80 V was used; resolving
gel, 120 V. Aer electrophoresis, Coomassie Blue G-250 was
used to stain the gel for 2 h and methyl acetate was used for
destaining.
2.4 Ultraltration of DA-P
For further purication, DA-P solution was ltered using an
ultraltration apparatus as described by Kimatu25 with minor
modications. Using 3 different membranes of different sizes,
DA-P was separated into four fractions with molecular weights
of <1, 1–3, 3–5, and >5 kDa. The four ultraltered fractions (UF)
were then lyophilized and stored at 20 C until further use.
The peptide content of UF was evaluated as described in 2.2.1
and the yield of UF was calculated as following:
UF yield ð%Þ ¼ Peptide weight in UF
Peptide weight before ultration  100%
2.5 Amino acid composition analysis
The amino acid composition of DA-P peptide and its fractions of
different molecular weight were determined using an A300 auto
amino acid analyzer (Membra Pure, Bodenheim, Germany) in
accordance with the method of You et al.26 with minor modi-
cation. Total amino acids composition was determined aer the
hydrolysis at 110 C for 24 h with 6 M HCl and derivatization
with ninhydrin. Free amino acids compositions were determined on the basis of the free amino acids in the supernatant
generated through centrifugation (10 000 rpm at 4 C for 10
min) of the precipitate from the mixture (mixing time 1 h) of
15% sulfosalicylic acid (1 mL) and test samples (4 mL). Appropriate dilutions of the obtained supernatant and ltration
(through 0.22 mm lter membrane) were required prior to total
and free amino acid analysis. Seventeen amino acid standards
were used as external standards.
2.6 HPLC-MS/MS analysis
Ultra high-pressure liquid chromatography combined with
high-resolution mass spectrometry (Agilent 1290/Brucker maXis
impact) was used to characterize the peptides structures in <1
kDa DA-P fraction. The chromatography column was an Agilent
SB-C18 RRHD column (1.8 mm, 2.1  50 mm) with a ow rate of
0.2 mL min1 at room temperature. The mobile phase of A was
acetonitrile and B was 0.1% formic acid water and the scanning
wavelength was 220 nm. In terms of acquisition parameter, the
source type was ESI with positive ion polarity, the dry heater was
set at 180 C. Initially during scanning, end plate offset was
500 V with 50 m/z and 4.01 min1 of dry gas. At the end of
scanning, charging voltage was 2000 V with 1000 m/z. The
injection volume of the sample was 20 mL.
2.7 Determination of antioxidant properties
2.7.1 Estimation of DPPH radical scavenging activity.
DPPH radical scavenging activity (DRSA) was assessed as
described by Kimatu25 with minor modications. Briey, 1 mL
of each of the four fractions (0–0.5 mg mL1
) was mixed with
4 mL DPPH (0.12 mM). The reaction was carried out at 37 C for
30 min in the dark. The DPPH solution without any sample was
considered the control and with VC being the positive control.
Optical density was determined at 517 nm. DRSA was calculated
as follows:
DRSA% ¼ AC  AS
AC
 100
where Ac and As are the absorbance values of the control and
sample groups, respectively. The DRSA% of the four fractions
was analyzed by comparing the concentration of samples that
caused a 50% reduction in DPPH radical.
Each sample was analyzed in triplicate.
2.7.2 Estimation of ABTS radical scavenging activity. ABTS
radical scavenging activity was determined as described by
Luo27 with minor modications. The working solution
comprised 7.4 mM ABTS stock solution with an equal volume of
2.6 mM potassium persulfate, and the reaction was carried out
for 12 h in the dark. The absorbance of diluted ABTS working
solution in PBS was 0.7  0.02 at 734 nm. Further, 0.2 mL of the
four fractions (0–0.5 mg mL1
) and distilled water were added
to 2 mL diluted ABTS working solution as the sample and
control, respectively. The reaction was carried out for 6 min at
room temperature in the dark and optical density was determined at 734 nm. ABTS radical scavenging activity was calculated as follows:
ABTS radical scavenging activity% ¼ AC  AS
AC
 100
where Ac and As are the absorbance values of the control and
sample groups, respectively. All experiments were conducted in
triplicate and compared with the unfermented sample.
2.7.3 Estimation of FRAP. The reducing power of DA-P was
assessed as described by Moktan10 with minor modications.
One milliliter of the four fractions (0–0.5 mg mL1
) was diluted
with 2.5 mL 0.2 M phosphate buffer. The diluted samples were
mixed with 2.5 mL 1% potassium ferricyanide and incubated at
50 C. Aer 20 min, 2.5 mL 10% TCA was added for 10 min to
terminate the reaction. The reaction solution was mixed with
2.5 mL distilled water and 1.0 mL 0.1% FeCl3 for 10 min at room

temperature. Aer centrifugation for 10 min at 1000  g, the
optical density of the supernatant was determined at 700 nm.
VC was used as the positive control. All experiments were conducted in triplicate and compared with the unfermented
sample.
2.8 Determination of erythrocyte hemolysis induced by
AAPH
2.8.1 Erythrocyte hemolysis assay. Erythrocyte oxidative
hemolysis protection of Mw < 1 kDa fraction reduced by AAPH
was analyzed as described by Zhang17 with minor modications.
All experiments were performed in compliance with “China
food safety standards GB151935-2014”, and approved by the
ethics committee at South China University of Technology.
Informed consents were obtained from human participants of
this study. Erythrocytes were obtained aer three washes with
PBS (pH 7.4) and centrifugation (1200  g, 10 min, 4 C) of
blood samples. Erythrocyte suspensions were diluted with 4-
fold PBS (pH 7.4) and then 200 mL erythrocyte suspensions were
added to 200 mL PBS or Mw < 1 kDa fraction solutions (0–1.5 mg
mL1
). The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 C and then
400 mL 0.2 mM AAPH was added, followed by incubation for 2 h
with gentle shaking. This mixture was diluted with 3.2 mL PBS
(pH 7.4) and centrifuged (1200  g, 10 min, 4 C). The optical
density of the supernatant was determined at 540 nm for the
treated group. Ultrapure water was added to the above
suspension to achieve 100% hemolysis. The hemolysis inhibition rate was calculated as follows:
Hemolysis inhibition rate% ¼
1  OD540 of sample treated group
OD540 of 100% hemolysis  100
Three independently replicated determinations were
analyzed for each sample.
2.8.2 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. Before
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (model 1530VP, LEO,
Oberkochen, Germany), the control, AAPH, and AAPH with Mw <
1 kDa DA-P fraction samples were prepared as described by
Liao.28
2.8.3 Estimation of intracellular ROS level. The erythrocytes were obtained as described by Zhang17 with minor modi-
cations, but the supernatant was discarded aer 3 washes with
PBS (pH 7.4) and erythrocytes were resuspended aer dilution
in a 5-fold volume of PBS (pH 7.4). Further, 100 mL of the
erythrocyte resuspension was used to determine the intracellular ROS levels. Aer centrifugation (1200  g, 10 min, 4 C),
200 mL of 10 mM DCFH-DA was added, followed by incubation
for 25 min at 37 C in the dark. The solution was washed and
resuspended in 600 mL PBS (pH 7.4). The uorescence intensity
of erythrocytes was measured with a Fluoroskan Ascent microplate uorometer (ex/em, 488/525 nm) (Thermo Scientic).
2.8.4 Determination of MDA, GPX, SOD, CAT, GSSG, and
GSH. The erythrocytes were obtained as described by Zhang17
with minor modications, but the supernatant was discarded
aer 3 washes with PBS (pH 7.4) and erythrocytes were added to
double ultrapure water in an ice-water bath for 10 min and then
centrifuged (1200  g, 10 min, 4 C) to obtain the cell lysis
buffer. The content of protein, GSH, GSSG, and MDA were
determined using bicinchoninic acid, GSH, and microscale
MDA kits, respectively. A cellular glutathione peroxidase kit,
total superoxide dismutase assay kit, and catalase assay kit were
used to determine the activities of GSH-Px, SOD, and CAT,
respectively.
2.9 Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as the mean  standard deviation (SD) of
three replicates. Signicant differences between the means of
parameters were calculated using Duncan's multiple-range test
using SPSS 17.0 soware (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A Pvalue less than 0.05 was considered statistically signicant.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Strain determination of Lactobacillus on solid-state
fermentation
In this study, 8 species of Lactobacillus, which are known to be
safe strains, were used in fermentation of D. aphyllum and the
peptide levels aer fermentation and those extracted under the
same conditions are shown in Fig. 1A. Compared to the control
group (7.82  0.57%), all strains fermented showed increased
peptide content, with L. amylolyticus L6 showing the best results
(17.85  0.54%). L. amylolyticus is widely used in foods processing. L. amylolyticus L6, which has been evaluated by 16S
rDNA and 23S rDNA sequencing, was isolated from spontaneously acidied tofu and was found to be non-toxic and nonhyper-susceptible, indicating that it can increase the antioxidant activities of fermented food sources.29 Owing to its superior capability to increase peptide contents and its safety and
health benets, L. amylolyticus L6 was determined as a good
microbial source for D. aphyllum solid-state fermentation.
3.2 Analysis of protease activity
As shown in Fig. 1B, the activity of total, acid, neutral, and
alkaline proteases were evaluated at different fermentation
times. For the initial 48 h fermentation, all protease activities
increased, aer which time all protease activities decreased to
different degrees. The activity of alkaline protease continuously
increased until 60 h of fermentation and then steadily
decreased. Therefore, the time point for optimum fermentation
was approximately 48 h. The dynamic regulation of protease
activities was in accordance with the content variation of
peptides, as shown in Fig. 1C; the highest yield of peptides was
achieved at approximately 48 h, indicating that peptide quantity
inuences protease activity. Moreover, throughout fermentation, the activity of neutral protease was nearly 2 times (p < 0.05)
that of alkaline and acid enzyme activity, indicating that neutral
protease signicantly contributes to the production of peptides
during fermentation. Importantly, alkaline and acidic enzyme
activities were also high at above 200 U g1
, demonstrating the
synergic effects of using three types of proteases to generate
peptides during fermentation.

3.3 Fermentative optimization
Single-factor experiments showed that the ratio of material to
solvent, inoculum size, and fermentation time signicantly
inuenced peptide yield during fermentation (results not
shown). A Box–Behnken design of RSM was developed to optimize the fermentation conditions of DA-P from D. aphyllum and
the nal predictive equation was obtained by eliminating
insignicant factors as shown below:
R1 ¼ 14.96 + 1.38A + 2.01B + 0.83C + 1.66AB  1.41AC
1.39BC  2.05A2
where A was the ratio of material to solvent (g mL1
); B was
inoculum size (%); C was fermentation time (h).
The optimum fermentation conditions for DA-P from
D. aphyllum were a material-to-solvent ratio of 1 : 4.775, inoculum size of 21.88%, and fermentation time of 46.02 h, with
a predicted result of 18.89%. A ratio of material to solvent of
1 : 4 (w/v), inoculum size of 21%, and time 46 h were selected to
validate the RSM model. The yield of extracting DA-P aer
fermentation was 18.23  0.046%, which agreed with the predicted result.
3.4 SDS-PAGE
The molecular weight (Mw) distributions of polypeptides before
and aer solid-state fermentation with L. amylolyticus L6 were
determined through SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 2, the standard Mw bonds are labeled as the M-band. Comparison of
before (C-band) and aer (F-band) fermentation revealed that
the C-band mainly consisted of molecules sized approximately
31 kDa and higher, indicating that high-Mw polypeptides were
present before fermentation, particularly major protein bands
at approximately 80, 68, 48, and 37 kDa. The intensity of highMw bands was reduced and the major Mw bands were below 31
kDa and primarily below 20 kDa, indicating that small molecules were successfully generated during fermentation.25
3.5 Concentration and identication of the peptide in DA-P
fractions
The DA-P peptide subjected to the ultraltration processes had
a peptide content of 83.91  1.71%. Aer ultraltration
processes, the peptide percentage yields of its <1 kDa fraction
was 45.84  1.37%, 1–3 kDa fraction was 32.44  2.78%, 3–5
kDa fraction was 3.22  0.81% and >5 kDa fraction was 2.70 
0.45%. These data suggest that mainly low molecular weight
peptides existed in DA-P fractions.
Amino acid composition was one of the factors inuencing
the antioxidant activity of peptides.30 Data on the total and free
amino acid composition of DA-P before ultraltration and its
four ultraltration fractions is shown in Table 1. The percentage
of total amino acids in DA-P peptide sample was the highest,
followed by the <1 kDa fraction. The sum of amino acids in the
other 3 fractions was higher than 40 g/100 g. In addition, the
percentage of free amino acid in <1 kDa DA-P fraction were as
high as 26.22  3.79. Since quantitative of antioxidative free
amino acid existed in that fraction, we inferred that <1 kDa DA-P

Lactobacillus rhamnosus (C1), Lactobacillus amylolyticus 5 (L5), Lactobacillus amylolyticus 6 (L6), and Lactobacillus acidophilus (mfm). The

fraction may have had optimal antioxidant activity. Hydrophobic amino acids (HAAs), including Ala, Val, Ile, Leu, Tyr,
Phe, Try, Pro, Met, and Cys, were reported to increase the
solubility of peptides in lipids, resulting in the entry into target
organs through hydrophobic associations or promoting relevant interaction with free radicals.31 In our study, the <1 kDa
and 1–3 kDa fractions had high amino acid levels, indicating
that those fractions may have high antioxidant activity in the
DPPH free radical scavenging assay, which is more suited for
samples with lipophilic antioxidants or those with a high lipid
content.32 Furthermore, the <1 kDa and 1–3 kDa fractions
contained higher levels of terms of negatively charged amino
acids (NCAAs) and aromatic amino acids (AAAs), than the large
molecular weight fractions. These amino acids have been
proved to enhance the potency of radical scavenging activities
owing to the abundance of their electrons that can stabilize
electron-decient radicals and then quench free radicals.33
Therefore, low molecular weight DA-P fractions are able to
donate abundant protons than large molecular weight fractions, thereby leading to high free radical scavenging capability.
In general, the high level of essential amino acids in all samples
indicated that the DA-P peptide and its four fractions have high
nutritional quality and optimal antioxidant activity.
High resolution mass spectrometer, that is able to low the
errors availably, is one of the effective instrument to characterize the sequences of polypeptides especially peptide in
complex matrix. Under ESI-MS/MS conditions, normally the
polypeptide will be protonated and the fragmentation will start
at the amide bonds. Ions of b and y are the major fragment ions
when the collision energy is below 200 eV due to the slight
effects of low energy on breaking the chemical bonds in side
chains.34 In terms of peptide identication, the ions of a, b, c, x,
y, z and a, b, c/x, y, z-17/18(–NH3/–H2O) are the meaningful MS/
MS data to determine the peptide characterization through
processing the de novo sequencing by the Biolynx peptide
sequencer.35,36 In our study, HPLC-MS/MS was carried out to
determine the sequences of peptides in <1 kDa fraction and the
results were performed in Table 2. In general, 21 types of
peptide were identied in DA-P <1 kDa fractions, which
molecular mass were all in the range from 300 to 600 Da. The
small molecular peptides contained various antioxidative
amino acids including NCAAs, AAAs and HAAs.
3.6 Free radical scavenging ability of DA-P fractions
Assays for assessing antioxidant capability are classied into
two methods based on the different types of chemical reactions
used. One method is based on hydrogen atom transfer, such as
total radical trapping antioxidant parameters and oxygen
radical absorbance capacity. The other method is based on
electron transfer and includes FRAP, ABTS, and DPPH radicalscavenging assays.3 Hydrogen atom transfer-based reactions
are related to radical chain-breaking antioxidant capability;
hence, electron transfer-based assays are typically used to
evaluate the antioxidant capability of peptides, which act as
probes for monitoring reactions and indicate reaction
endpoints.37 In our study, three traditional electron transferTable 2 Peptides identified by HPLC/MSMS in <1 kDa DA-P fractions

based assays were performed for DA-P before and aer
fermentation, as well as fractions with different ranges of
molecular weights including <1, 1–3, 3–5, and >5 kDa aer
ultraltration; the results are shown in Fig. 3. For all sample
concentrations, antioxidant activity changed in a dosedependent manner. The scavenging rate of most concentrations was higher in the fermented groups than in the unfermented groups, indicating that during L. amylolyticus L6
fermentation, proteolytic enzymes produced by the microbial
populations efficiently hydrolyzed the protein into strong antioxidant peptides and free amino acids.12 Additionally, the
scavenging rate of the before-ultraltration groups was generally higher than that of the aer-ultraltration fractions with
molecular weights of 1–3, 3–5, and >5 kDa. These results indicate that maybe the constituent peptides in these molecular
weight groups were mostly negatively charged and had synergistic effects.38
In DPPH free radical scavenging assay, a stable centered
nitrogen lipophilic free radical existed in DPPH. In the presence
of a hydrogen-donating antioxidant, the reduction of DPPH free
radicals would occur by inducing non-radical formation with
DPPH binding hydrogen atoms.39,40 The mechanism of ABTS
free radical scavenging assay is similar to that of DPPH radical
scavenging assay, both based on single electron transfer.41 As
shown in Fig. 3A and B, the scavenging rate of the <1 kDa
fraction was higher than those of the parent proteins and
before-ultraltration peptides, possibly because released lowmolecular weight peptides and amino acids served as extra
sources of electrons and protons.42 Yang et al. reported that
steric structure and molecular weight of the peptides, rather
than their antioxidant amino acid content, might play an
important role in scavenging DPPH radicals, which was
consistent with our ndings.43 In terms of reducing power
assay, the reduction of Fe3+ or ferricyanide complex to Fe2+ is
carried out in the presence of a reductant, when evaluating
which compounds in the extract samples are electron donors to
reduce the oxidized intermediates of lipid peroxidation, and act
as primary and secondary antioxidants.10 It was previously reported that different activities of peptides fractions were mainly
because of different amino acid side-chain groups, since
electron-dense areas are exposed as hydrolysis progresses, and
electron donors convert free radicals into more stable products
that terminate the radical chain reaction.10,44 Therefore, we can
infer that the ferric reducing power depends on fermentation
patterns and DA-P sizes. A greater ability to donate electrons
was observed for fraction <1 kDa, which is concurrent with
pervious results.42
3.7 Attenuation of erythrocyte hemolysis by DA-P
The <1 kDa DA-P fraction displayed the strongest chemical
antioxidant ability was thus was further analyzed through
AAPH-induced oxidative stress assays to evaluate human
erythrocyte hemolysis. The hemolysis inhibition rate was
related to the type and concentration of the sample, as shown in
Fig. 4A. The inhibition rate of the control group on human
erythrocyte hemolysis was the highest at 96.89  0.11; thus,
erythrocytes existed in the absence of antioxidative stress, in
which the corresponding red cell membrane showed a normal
biconcave discoid morphology, according to SEM analysis
(Fig. 5A). The inhibition rate following treatment with the <1
kDa DA-P fraction was similar to that of the control, indicating
that the peptide was nontoxic and did not inuence erythrocyte
hemolysis. When treated with AAPH, oxidative stress on erythrocyte led to hemolysis with the lowest inhibition rate (28.4 
0.68%); the normal prole was lost and spiny structures formed
on the surface, as shown in Fig. 5B. During erythrocyte hemolysis at 37 C, alkyl radicals are generated through decomposition by AAPH; through the contribution of oxygen, peroxyl
radicals form and cause lipid peroxidation and the loss of
membrane integrity.17 Pretreatment with a gradient concentration of Mw < 1 kDa DA-P fraction showed greater inhibition of
hemolysis of AAPH-induced erythrocytes in a dose-response
manner. The protective effect of Mw < 1 kDa DA-P fraction on
AAPH-induced morphological improvement in human

experiments.

erythrocytes was conrmed through SEM imaging, with
membrane damage signicantly reduced in cells pretreated
with 1.5 mg mL1 of the <1 kDa DA-P fraction before the
addition of AAPH (Fig. 5C).
Antioxidants can directly act as free radical scavengers or
improve antioxidant systems. In this study, both antioxidative
mechanisms were evaluated, including non-enzymatic and
enzymatic antioxidant systems.
DCFH-DA, a uorescein-labeled dye, is non-uorescent and
can cross the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm and
become hydrolyzed to form DCF, a highly uorescent
compound, by nonspecic esterases.15 Therefore, under oxidative stress, uorescence increases. In our study, by evaluating
the intensity of DCF uorescence, erythrocyte intracellular ROS
generation was prevented by Mw < 1 kDa DA-P fraction antioxidative protective effects, as shown in Fig. 4B. Without treatment, DCF uorescence in the control group showed the lowest
value of 224  5.11, while following AAPH treatment, DCF
uorescence was very high at 480  10.68, indicating that AAPH
increased oxidative stress. However, following pretreatment
with different concentrations of the <1 kDa DA-P fraction, the
intensity decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Particularly,
a peptide concentration of 1.5 mg mL1 yielded the best antioxidative protection by reducing intracellular ROS generation.
Because no signicant difference in DCF uorescence was
observed for erythrocytes treated with the <1 kDa fraction alone
compared with that in the control, the <1 kDa fraction was
unable to generate ROS in erythrocytes. In summary, the free

Erythrocytes were pretreated with DA-P fraction (molecular weight <1 kDa, concentration of 0–1.5 mg mL1
) for 30 min prior to AAPH (200 mM)
treatment for 2 h; the positive group was treated with 200 mM AAPH alone and control group was treated with 1.5 mg mL1 DA-P alone. Data are
mean  standard deviations of three independent experiments.

radical scavenger <1 kDa DA-P fraction inhibited intracellular
AAPH-induced ROS generation in erythrocytes in a dosedependent manner.
Excess ROS generation can cause lipid peroxidation, which
directly increases MDA levels. Excess MDA negatively affects
tumor promotion, cellular metabolism disruption, and cell
membrane dysfunction. In our study, the MDA level is shown in
Fig. 6B. The lowest level of MDA was 0.548  0.011 nm mg1
protein in the control group without peptide or AAPH treatment, whereas under AAPH-induced oxidative stress, the MDA
level was 1.831  0.068 nm mg1 protein. It is not surprising
that Mw < 1 kDa DA-P fraction decreased the MDA level in
a dose-dependent manner and was similar to the MDA level in
the control group when the concentration of Mw < 1 kDa fraction
was 1.5 mg mL1
. Additionally, the MDA level in the Mw < 1 kDa
fraction alone group (0.563  0.02 nm mg1 protein), which was
similar to that in the control, indicated that Mw < 1 kDa fraction
alone did not increase MDA levels. In general, Mw < 1 kDa DA-P
fraction can prevent AAPH-induced MDA accumulation by
decreasing ROS generation.
To determine whether the enzymatic antioxidative system is
present in erythrocytes, the activities of antioxidant enzymes
including SOD, CAT, and GPx were evaluated. As shown in
Fig. 6, the groups treated with AAPH alone showed very high
enzyme activities, which were 368.02  10.68 U mg1 protein for
CAT, 18.31  0.68 U mg1 protein for SOD, and 18.31  0.16 U
mg1 protein or GPx, while the activities of CAT (Fig. 6A), SOD
(Fig. 6C), and GPx (Fig. 6D) decreased steadily with increasing
concentrations of <1 kDa DA-P fraction in a dose-dependent
manner. Enzyme activities in the control groups were the
lowest, with values of 96.05  5.11 U mg1 protein for CAT, 6.89
 0.11 U mg1 protein for SOD, and 5.48  0.12 U mg1 protein
for GPx. In addition, enzyme activity levels in the group pretreated with Mw < 1 kDa fraction alone were similar to those of
the control, indicating that the <1 kDa DA-P fraction itself did
not increase oxidative-related enzyme activities. In conclusion,
Mw < 1 kDa DA-P fraction modulated intracellular antioxidant
enzyme activity, particularly at high concentrations.
In the erythrocyte intracellular enzyme system, CAT converts
hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water.6 SOD catalyzes the
conversion of highly reactive superoxide anion to less reactive
oxygen and hydrogen peroxide through dismutation. Excess
hydrogen peroxide can be reduced by CAT and GPx to prevent
hydrogen peroxide from being converted into more active
species such as hydroxyl radicals, which promote cell death.16,17
Moreover, GPx catalyzes the conversion of glutathione from the
reduced form GSH to the oxidized form GSSH. Circulating GPx
can protect erythrocytes from oxidative damage by increasing
GSH levels (Fig. 6E) and decreasing GSSG levels (Fig. 6F) aer
pretreatment of erythrocytes with the >150 mg mL1 < 1 kDa DAP fraction.
There are two mechanisms involved in maintaining antioxidative effects during erythrocyte hemolysis. First, antioxidants form a protective membrane with an electronegative
outer surface around erythrocytes without promoting antioxidase and gene expression, preventing contact between free
radicals and the plasma membrane to inhibit ROS generation.17
Second, antioxidants directly quench the cellular antioxidant
system.6 Since DA-P was puried to low-molecular weight
peptide fractions <1 kDa via ultraltration, which functioned as
a free radical scavenger in chemical oxidative reactions, we infer
that the low-weight DA-P peptide fraction passed through the
erythrocyte membrane and directly inhibited ROS generation
and MDA formation induced by AAPH and also regulated

intracellular antioxidant enzyme activity. The details of the
protective effects of <1 kDa DA-P fractions during oxidative
erythrocyte hemolysis induced by AAPH are shown in Fig. 7.
4 Conclusions
In this study, antioxidative peptides were extracted from D.
aphyllum aer optimizing Lactobacillus solid-state fermentation. Aer identifying the optimum strain for fermentation as L.
amylolyticus L6, an RSM model was used to optimize fermentation conditions, which were a material-to-solvent ratio of 1 : 4
(w/v), inoculum size of 21%, and fermentation time of 46 h. DAP yield obtained under the optimized fermentation conditions
was 18.23  0.046%. Analysis of amino acid composition indicated high antioxidative potential of the low molecular weight
DA-P fractions and HPLC-MS/MS analysis proved that 21
different types of polypeptides existed in the <1 kDa DA-P
fraction. Through the ET-based assay, the <1 kDa DA-P fraction showed satisfactory antioxidative abilities in chemicalbased antioxidative assays, including DPPH and ABTS free
radical scavenging assays and the reducing power assay, in
which that fraction could scavenge free radicals to prevent
oxidation. Changing the concentration of DA-P altered antioxidative capabilities because of the increasing antioxidative
peptide content, with the <1 kDa DA-P fraction yielding the best
results. According to the results of the human erythrocyte
AAPH-induced hemolysis assay, the <1 kDa DA-P fraction
quenched the intracellular antioxidant system by inhibiting
ROS generation, preventing MDA formation, and regulating
cellular antioxidative enzyme activity, including SOD, CAT, and
GPx. Additionally, GPx increased GSH content and decreased
GSSG content. Therefore, the novel antioxidative <1 kDa fraction isolated from D. aphyllum aer L. amylolyticus L6-solidstate optimized fermentation may be useful in functional
foods and complementary medicine. This study provides
a foundation for the further investigation on peptides of Dendrobium, particularly D. aphyllum.
