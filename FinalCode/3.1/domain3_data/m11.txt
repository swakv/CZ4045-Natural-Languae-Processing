Abstract
Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are useful tools for the delivery of a wide variety of
cargo into cells. Our lab has developed two classes of CPPs based on β-hairpin
sequences, one that folds at the surface of cell membranes and the other that is
intrinsically disordered. Although these peptides can effectively deliver different
types of cargo, their use in protein delivery has been hindered due to the presence of
non-natural D-proline within the central turn region of both sequences, which
prohibits functionalizing proteins with the CPPs via standard expression protocols. In
this work, we describe new CPPs that replace the non-natural turn region with natural turn motifs amenable to protein expression. We first investigate how these
changes within the turn affect various CPP-related properties in the absence of protein cargo, and then generate protein fusions for intracellular delivery.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are promising compounds that can
deliver membrane-impermeable therapeutics into cells for improved
efficacy.[1–6] The mechanism in which CPPs enter cells can be affected
by both the peptide sequence and the type of attached cargo, with
common modes of transport involving direct translocation through the
outer membrane or various forms of endocytosis.[4,7–9] Although they
have different intended functions, lytic anticancer and antimicrobial
peptides often share many features with CPPs, such as amphiphilicity,
high positive charge content, and the ability to adopt secondary structure when engaging with negatively charged surfaces.[10–16] For example, our lab previously developed the anticancer peptide SVS1, which
acts through a lytic mechanism dependent on the peptide's ability to
bind to negatively charged components of cell surfaces and fold into
β-hairpin-rich structures that disrupt the membrane.[17–19] Later studies
demonstrated that when administered below its cytotoxic concentration, SVS1 could act as a CPP and effectively deliver small molecule
cargo,[20] gold nanocolloids,[21] and quantum dots[22] into cells. Furthermore, when SVS1 was conjugated to the chemotherapeutic Paclitaxel, it
provided improved in vivo antitumor activity over treatment with free
drug.[20] The cell entry mechanism for SVS1 was similar to many common CPPs, involving a mixture of endocytosis and physical translocation. Continued efforts led to the development of a new class of
intrinsically disordered CPPs.[23] The optimized peptide CLIP6 had several improved features over SVS1, such as reduced cytotoxicity and a
mechanism for small molecule delivery based solely on direct translocation across the cell membrane. The key component of CLIP6 that lead
to these improvements was the replacement of a valine residue with a
negatively charged glutamate, which disrupted an otherwise perfect
hydrophobic face within an amphiphilic β-hairpin sequence and
prevented the peptide from folding at the cell membrane.[24] While this
glutamate substitution afforded several benefits, the introduction of a
negatively charged residue reduced CLIP6's overall cell uptake, indicating that further improvement within this class of CPP would be desirable. In addition to their intriguing uptake properties, hairpin-based
CPPs often have improved stability toward proteolysis over linear

sequences,[20,23,25] which would be advantageous for in vivo delivery
applications.
In this report, we use our family of CPPs to bring proteins into cells.
Many, if not all protein therapeutics on the market today interact with
extracellular targets. Although these types of therapies have had tremendous success, the ability to target intracellular interactions efficiently would be a transformative accomplishment and we wondered
whether SVS1 or CLIP6 could be useful starting points in designing
CPPs capable of delivering proteins. For practical purposes, we sought
to develop a system where the CPP would be fused to a protein of
interest via standard protein expression rather than using chemical,[26]
enzymatic,[27,28] or NCL-based conjugation methods,[29,30] which all add
additional synthetic steps that require optimization. However, both
SVS1 and CLIP6 contain a non-natural D-residue within their central
β-turn regions that prohibit standard expression. Therefore, we
designed analogs of these CPPs that replaced the original turn residues
with naturally occurring turn motifs (Figure 1).[31] We first synthesized
the peptides by solid phase synthesis to evaluate how the turn residues
affect CPP-related properties in the absence of protein cargo. Gratifyingly, these expression-capable SVS1 and CLIP6 analogs (termed XS
and XC, respectively) retained CPP activity and demonstrated a diverse
range of cytotoxicity and uptake behavior dependent on their
capabilities to fold into β-hairpin conformations. We then fused the
CPPs with EGFP via bacterial expression and demonstrated that intracellular protein delivery was possible.
2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 | Materials
All chemicals, reagents, buffers, and media were obtained from commercial vendors. POPC and POPS lipids were purchased from Avanti
Polar Lipids. Gateway BP/LR cloning kits and DH5α subcloning efficiency cells were purchased from Invitrogen. Rosetta 2 (DE3) pLysS
was purchased from EMD Millipore. DNA primers were purchased
from Integrated DNA Technologies. PCR kits and minipreps were purchased from Qiagen. The initial EGFP-containing plasmid and the
empty pDonr253, pDest527, and pDest566 vectors were obtained
from the Protein Expression Laboratory of the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research.
2.2 | Peptide synthesis and purification
All peptides were synthesized on an ABI 433a automated peptide synthesizer using rink amide resin at a 0.25 mmol scale. Fmoc deprotection
was performed using 19% piperidine/1% DBU in NMP for
5 minutes cycles and was monitored to completion through conductivity measurements after each cycle. Fmoc amino acids (5 eq) were dissolved in NMP, activated by HCTU (4.5 eq) in DMF and DIEA (10 eq),
and coupled to the resin for 30 minutes with constant vortexing. At the
end of the synthesis, aliquots of resin were removed (~0.025 mmol) and
reacted with NHS-fluorescein (2 eq) in DMF on a manual wrist-action
shaker overnight. After washing and drying the peptides on resin, they
were cleaved from resin for 3 hours (95% TFA, 2.5% TIPS, and 2.5%
H2O), after which the resin was filtered off, and the collected filtrate
was concentrated. Following ether precipitation, crude solids were dried
under vacuum. All peptides were purified by prep-HPLC. Crude peptides were dissolved in Std A (0.1% TFA in Milli-Q water; 4 mg/mL for
unlabeled peptides, 2 mg/mL for fluorescently-labeled peptides) and
5 mL per run was injected into a Waters 600 system, equipped with a
Waters 2489 UV Detector and a Vydac 218TP column (250 × 22 mm,
10 μm, heated to 40 C). A gradient of 1% Std B (80% MeCN, 0.1%
TFA, and 19.9% Milli-Q water) per min was used. The UV trace at
220 nm was monitored and fractions containing the major peptide peak
were combined and lyophilized. Purity was assessed by LCMS
(Shimadzu LCMS 2020) and analytical HPLC (Agilent 1200 series, Vydac
218TP column, 250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm, heated to 40 C) using gradients
of 1% Std B per min.
2.3 | Plasmid generation for EGFP and CPP-fused
analogs
Primers encoding N-terminal cleavage domain (either FXa or TEV protease sites to remove His tag) and C-terminal CPP domains underwent
overlap-extension PCR using the Qiagen Fast Cycling PCR kit with an
FIGURE 1 Expression-capable analogs of SVS1 (XS) and CLIP6
(XC). A, SVS1 folds at cell surfaces and enters through a mixture of
uptake mechanisms, but can be lytic. CLIP6 is intrinsically disordered, is
less toxic, and delivers small molecules through direct translocation.
Analogs of SVS1 and CLIP6, utilizing natural turn residues, have altered
CPP properties and can be fused to protein cargo through expression. B,

EGFP-containing plasmid as the template. PCR products were purified
using the QIAquick PCR purification kit, then subjected to Gateway BP
cloning using the pDonr253 donor vector, transformed into DH5α subcloning efficiency cells, and plated on LB agar plates containing 50 μg/mL
spectinomycin. The plates were grown overnight at 37 C. Single colonies were picked and grown overnight in 10 mL LB media with 50 μg/mL
spectinomycin at 37 C, 250 RPM. Minipreps were performed to isolate
amplified entry vectors. Once the sequences were validated (using
Macrogen standard sequencing), the vectors were subjected to Gateway
LR cloning using the pDest527 (N-terminal His tag) or pDest566
(N-terminal His-MBP tag) vector, transformed into DH5α subcloning
efficiency cells, and plated on LB agar plates containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin. The plates were grown overnight at 37 C. Single colonies were
picked and grown overnight in 10 mL LB media with 100 μg/mL ampicillin at 37 C, 250 RPM. Minipreps were performed to isolate amplified
expression vectors and the sequences were validated prior to expression.
When not in use, vectors were stored at −20 C.
2.4 | Protein expression, purification, and His-tag
removal
Expression vectors were transformed into Rosetta 2 (DE3) pLysS competent cells and plated on LB agar containing 100 μg/mL carbenicillin
and 34 μg/mL chloramphenicol. The plates were grown overnight at
37 C. Single colonies were picked and grown overnight in 20 mL LB
media, containing 100 μg/mL carbenicillin and 34 μg/mL chloramphenicol, at 37 C, 250 RPM. 5 mL of overnight culture was used to
seed 500 mL of LB (100 μg/mL carbenicillin and 34 μg/mL chloramphenicol), and the culture was shaken at 37 C, 250 RPM. OD600 was
monitored until reaching a value of 0.6-0.8, usually around
2-2.5 hours. At this point, the incubator temperature was reduced to
17 C and the flasks were cooled for 15 minutes. To induce expression, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM and the flasks
were shaken at 17 C, 250 RPM for 20 hours. Each flask was split into
2 × 250 mL centrifuge bottles and spun down for 20 minutes at
7000 g. The supernatant was removed, and the pellets were stored at
−80 C until purification. Pilot expressions had first been conducted
to optimize conditions on a small scale at varied temperature/time
(37/17 C for 6/20 hours respectively) and IPTG concentration
(1/0.5/0.25 mM), resulting in the conditions used above.
Pellets (from 500 mL culture) were resuspended in 20 mL lysis
buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 1x Bug Buster, and 1 EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet) and
subjected to sonication (amplitude setting of 1, 1 second on, 1 second
off, 1.5 minutes total on). The lysate was then centrifuged at 4 C,
7000 g for 20 minutes and the supernatant was syringe filtered
(0.45 μm). Using a GE P-960 sample pump, the lysate was injected into
a GE ATKA FPLC system equipped with a 5 mL Talon resin column.
Purification was carried out using a step gradient of 0/20/60/100% B
(Buffer A: 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM
imidazole; Buffer B: 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl,
100 mM imidazole). Fractions were monitored for absorbance at
280/488 nm (EGFP), typically eluting at 60 and/or 100% B. Purity was
confirmed by SDS PAGE gel, with the pure fractions combined and
subjected to several rounds of buffer exchanges into 50 mM sodium
phosphate pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal
filters (MWCO 10 kDa) to achieve sub-micromolar imidazole concentrations. The concentrated protein was diluted to 1.5 mL, and the concentration was determined by UV (EGFP: ε = 56 000 M−1 cm−1 at
488 nm). Typical yields for His-FXa-EGFP were over 50 mg per L culture, whereas the His-TEV-EGFP-XC1/2 analogs had yields up to
10 mg per L culture. The His-TEV-EGFP-XS1/2 sequences had pIs
(~8) close to the pH needed for optimal purification, which made them
difficult to solubilize after cell lysis. Additionally, the XS1 analogs did
not produce fluorescent pellets. Therefore, His-MBP-TEV-EGFPXS1/2 constructs were made to improve solubility and activity.
His-MBP-TEV-EGFP-XS2 led to yields of ~10 mg per L culture. Unfortunately, the XS1 analog still did not produce a fluorescent pellet
indicating that folded and functional protein was not produced.
For removal of the N-terminal His-6 tag encoded in the pDest527
expression vector, FXa or TEV proteases were employed. For the generation of free EGFP, FXa cleavage was used. A typical experiment would
use 5 mg (determined by UV) of His-FXa-EGFP in 20 mL of cleavage
buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2) and 100 μg of
FXa (protein:enzyme weight ratio of ~50:1). The reaction was monitored by SDS PAGE gel and was typically completed within 7 hours.
The reaction solution was added to prewashed p-aminobenzamidine
functionalized resin to bind FXa, allowed to rock at RT for 30 minutes,
and then the resin was filtered using an empty polypropylene column.
EGFP was exchanged in to Milli-Q water using Amicon Ultra-15 filters
(MWCO 10 kDa) and typically achieved near quantitative yields
(~4.5 mg from 5 mg NH6 fusion). The CPP domains were susceptible to
nonspecific cleavage by FXa, and a TEV cleavage site was installed to
circumvent this. The protocol for cleavage by Halo-TEV protease
(Promega) followed that of the manufacturer. A typical experiment
would use 3 mg (determined by UV) of NH6-TEV-ID#-EGFP/mRuby3
in 3 mL buffer (50 mM phosphate, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl), 1 mM DTT,
and 10 μL HaloTEV protease. The reactions were monitored by SDS
PAGE gel and were typically completed under 7 hours. The completed
reaction solution was added to prewashed HaloLink resin for HaloTEV
removal. After slowly rocking at RT for 30 minutes, the resin was filtered using an empty polypropylene column. The EGFP-CPPs were
exchanged into buffer (50 mM phosphate, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl) using
Amicon Ultra-15 filters to reduce DTT concentration to sub-micromolar
levels and to remove the low molecular weight cleavage byproduct.
Yields of around 80% were typically achieved (~2.0 mg). After the cleavage of His-MBP-TEV-EGFP-XS2, the solution was also passed through
0.5 mL Talon resin to remove the cleaved His-MBP domain, as this
byproduct is too large for removal by dialysis. Additional buffer
exchanges were necessary to remove excess imidazole from EGFP-XS2.
2.5 | Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy to assess
peptide folding
CD spectra were collected on an Aviv Model 420 Spectrometer, using
50 μM peptide in either buffer alone (50 mM BTP, 150 mM KF,
MILLER AND SCHNEIDER 3 of 8
pH 7.4), buffer containing POPC liposomes, or a 1:1 ratio of POPC:
POPS liposomes (lipid:peptide ratio of 50:1). Liposomes were prepared and extruded to ~100 nm as previously described.[17] The sample, in a 1 mm pathlength cuvette, was placed into the instrument's
pre-heated sample holder (37 C) and equilibrated for 5 minutes.
Wavelength scans were then carried out at 37 C between 260 and
200 nm at 1 nm intervals, with an averaging time of 3 seconds at each
wavelength. A background spectrum of blank buffer was subtracted
from the sample spectra and the mean residue ellipticity [θ] was calculated from the equation [θ]=(θobs/10lc)/r, where θobs is the measured
ellipticity in millidegrees, l is the length of the cell in centimeters
(0.1 cm), c is the molar concentration (0.00005 M), and r is the number
of peptide bonds (18).
2.6 | Cell viability experiments in the presence
of CPPs
A549 cells were grown in T75 flasks using complete RPMI media supplemented with 10% FBS, and incubated at 37 C with 5% CO2 and
humidity control. Prior to experiments, cells were trypsinized with
3 mL 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution for 5 minutes, diluted with media,
pelleted by centrifugation, and reconstituted in media. The viable cells
were counted using trypan blue staining and the cells were diluted to
5 × 104 cells/mL. 100 μL of diluted cells was pipetted into wells of a
clear 96 well plate (5000 cells per well), then grown overnight
(~16 hours). Serial dilutions of each peptide were made in serum-free
RPMI. The overnight culture media was removed from the cells and
replaced with the peptide-containing media and incubated for
24 hours. Cells were also incubated in media without peptide and
media with 20% DMSO, as negative and positive controls, respectively. After a day, the media was removed and the cells were washed
with 100 μL media. After removal of the wash, 100 μL media was
added to cells, plus 10 μL of MTT solution (5 mg/mL in Milli-Q water).
The samples were incubated for 3 hours, after which the media was
removed and 150 μL of spectroscopic grade DMSO was added. The
plates were incubated at 37 C with light rocking for 15 minutes, then
read at 540 nm using a UV plate reader (Biotek). The absorbance of
the positive controls was subtracted from each sample as a blank, and
percent viability was calculated using the equation: (Abstreated/
Absuntreated) × 100. IC50 values were computed using Graphpad Prism
8 software and represented the average of three independent experiments, each in triplicate (n = 9).
2.7 | Cellular internalization of fluorescently-labeled
peptides and EGFP-CPPs
For flow cytometry, A549 cells were diluted to 5 × 105 cells/mL and
0.5 mL was added to clear 24 well plates (2.5 × 105 cells per well) and
incubated overnight (~16 hours) at 37 C with 5% CO2. Stocks of
fluorescently-labeled peptide or protein were made in buffer and the
concentrations were determined by UV absorbance (fluorescein:
ε494 = 70 000 M−1
; EGFP: ε488 = 56 000 M−1
) and diluted to 5 μM in
serum-free media. After removal of the overnight culture media,
0.5 mL peptide/protein solution was added to the wells and incubated
for 1 hour. The cells were then washed with media and incubated
with 150 μL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution for 15 minutes. The cells
were diluted with 0.5 mL cold PBS, transferred to 12 × 75 mm polystyrene tubes, placed on ice, and then analyzed by flow cytometry
using a BD FACSCalibur instrument. To assess the role of energy
dependent uptake mechanisms and clathrin-mediated endocytosis,
experiments were also conducted under ATP depletion and hyperosmolar sucrose conditions, respectively. Prior to peptide/protein
incubation, cells were pretreated with either with ATP depletion (glucose-free/serum-free RPMI, 10 mM sodium azide, and 50 mM
2-deoxy-D-glucose, 30 minutes) or hyperosmolar sucrose (serum-free
RPMI, 0.45 M sucrose, 1 hour), followed by peptide/protein incubation in respective media. Mean fluorescence statistics for each
peptide/protein were computed using Graphpad Prism 8 and significance values were determined by applying two-way ANOVA analysis.
For live cell imaging experiments, A549 cells were to diluted to
5 × 104 cells/mL in media and 2 mL was added to circular glass slides
(1 × 105 cells per slide). The cells were incubated overnight at 37 C
with 5% CO2. Stocks of EGFP and EGFP-XS2 were made, with concentrations determined by UV absorbance (ε488 = 56 000 M−1
). Both
proteins were diluted to 20 μM in serum-free media. After removal of
the overnight culture media, 2 mL of the protein solutions were added
to the slides and incubated for 5 hours. After 4.5 hours of incubation,
2 μL of 1 mg/mL Hoescht 33 342 dye was added to the slides, the
solution was gently aspirated, and the samples were incubated for an
additional 30 minutes. The cells were then washed with media and
imaged using a Zeiss LSM710 Confocal Microscope with an environmental chamber to maintain 37 C and 5% CO2. Microscopy images
were processed using ImageJ.
3 | RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1 | Altering the turn residues of SVS1 and CLIP6
affect folding, cytotoxicity, and cell uptake
mechanisms
SVS1 is a designed sequence with a strong propensity to fold into a
β-hairpin conformation when bound to negatively charged surfaces,
such as negatively charged membranes or the glycocalyx.[17,19] It contains two perfectly amphiphilic β-strands connected by a four-residue
sequence –VDPPT– (Figure 1B), which is known to avidly adopt a type
II0 reverse turn and drive hairpin folding when an appropriate surface
is engaged. Previous crystallographic studies using short model peptides have shown that this turn's preferred dihedral angles result in
the formation of a very regular β-hairpin.[32] CLIP6 also contains the
central –VDPPT– sequence, but the introduction of a glutamate residue on the hydrophobic face prohibits its ability to adopt a hairpin
conformation.[23] For XS1 and XC1, the non-natural turn was replaced
by the four-residue sequence –YNGT–,
[33] which is known to form a
type I0 reverse turn that is somewhat less effective at nucleating hairpin structure than D-proline-containing turns.[34] XS2 and XC2 contain a five-residue sequence known to form a type I β-bulge reverse

turn in proteins (Figure 1B), but this turn is less entropically favored in
the context of short peptides when compared to the four-residue
turns.[35] After synthesizing the peptides by solid phase synthesis
(Figure S1), we first performed CD experiments to assess how the different turn motifs affect the secondary structure of the new CPPs.
Studies were performed in buffer as well as in the presence of model
liposomes to assess how membrane surface charge might influence
folding. As we have seen previously with SVS1 and CLIP6,[17,23] all
sequences adopt unfolded conformations in physiological buffer and
in the presence of neutral POPC liposomes (Figure S2). However,
when incubated with liposomes containing the negatively charged
lipid POPS, SVS1 showed a spectrum consistent with a β-sheet-rich
structure (Figure 2A). Many cancer cells have increased negative
charge at their outer surface compared to noncancerous cells and this
charge-induced folding behavior could impart selectivity over which
cells the CPPs prefer to engage.[17] Both XS1 and XS2 adopt β-sheet
structure, but afford slightly different spectra compared to SVS1.
These differences are most likely due to both the differential contribution of the specific reverse turn structures to the far UV-CD and the
ability of each turn to promote the folding of a canonical β-hairpin.
For example, compared to SVS1, XS1 exhibits a spectrum that contains a degree of random coil contribution, which is even more prominent for XS2 (compare [θ] at 200 nm for each). As will be shown
below, the different turn types not only influence hairpin structure
but also function. With respect to CLIP6, XC1, and XC2, these peptides remain unfolded in the presence of negatively charged liposomes. Again, each of these sequences contains a glutamate on what
would be an otherwise perfect hydrophobic face of a hairpin conformation if the peptides were to fold. The inclusion of this charged residue represents a significant energetic barrier to folding even under
solution conditions that normally promote the formation of structure.
Thus, the natural turn motifs did not alter the conformational bias of
the glutamate-containing peptides and remain unfolded.
Next, we investigated how the different turns affected the bioactivity of the peptides toward human lung adenocarcinoma (A549)
cells. Most membrane-active peptides have the capacity to function
as both cell penetrating and lytic agents, with peptide concentration
dictating which function is enacted.[10] Cationic amphiphilic peptides
can penetrate cells at low concentrations, but lyse membranes at
higher concentrations. We first studied the lytic potential of the peptides in viability experiments, which demonstrated that cytotoxicity
was closely linked to peptide conformation (Figure 2B). SVS1, which
has the highest propensity to fold, was the most toxic (IC50 = 5 μM).
XS1 and XS2 showed stepwise decreases in cytotoxicity (17 and
80 μM, respectively), in-line with their decreased propensities to
adopt structure. Interestingly, although XC1 and XC2 were less toxic
than SVS1 and its derivatives as expected due to their inability to fold
(675 and 349 μM, respectively), they were still capable of killing cells
at higher concentrations. This is in contrast to CLIP6, which was
essentially nontoxic at the concentrations studied (>1 mM). This is
intriguing because on one hand, the –VDPPT– turn motif was responsible for the increased toxicity of well-folded SVS1 compared to its
lesser folded natural turn analogs, but that same turn sequence when
incorporated into intrinsically disordered CLIP6 endeared nontoxic
behavior relative to XC1 and XC2. Thus, it seems as if the glutamatecontaining peptides, although all unfolded, still have the capacity to
kill cells in a manner dependent on the residues within the turn region
of the peptide. It may be that the ensemble of disordered states defining unfolded CLIP6 may be quite different than those of XC1 and
XC2, perhaps due to the conformational bias imposed by the Dproline/L-proline motif, though this is only speculative at this point.
We next studied the cell penetrating properties of the peptides at
concentrations below their lytic IC50 values. Flow cytometry experiments were conducted with fluorescently-labeled peptides to assess
cellular uptake (Figure 2C, Table S1). In general, the SVS1 analogs had
greater overall uptake than the CLIP6 analogs. This demonstrates that
a well-folded conformation, which is more likely to engage with cell
surfaces, also leads to more efficient CPPs. Within the same family of
peptides, the –YNGT– turns (XS1/XC1) had greater uptake than the –
VPIGT– turns (XS2/XC2), indicating that the local conformation
imparted by the YNGT motif was more favorable for cell entry. Additionally, the different turns resulted in changes to the mechanisms
of cell uptake, which were probed using ATP depletion[36] and
hyperosmolar sucrose[37] conditions. ATP depletion shuts down
energy-dependent processes involved in uptake, such as all forms of
endocytosis and some forms of ion channels or transporters, whereas
FIGURE 2 Turn residues affect folding and activity. A, CD spectra in the presence of negatively charged POPC/POPS liposomes. B,

MILLER AND SCHNEIDER 5 of 8
hyperosmolar sucrose conditions shut down clathrin-mediated endocytosis. XS1 had similar overall uptake as SVS1 in the absence of
inhibitors, but showed an even greater reliance on clathrin-mediated
uptake. XS2, which had lower uptake than both SVS1 and XS1, still
had a noticeable portion of its uptake requiring energy-dependent
processes, but had a lesser contribution from clathrin-mediated endocytosis. For the intrinsically disordered sequences, both XC1 and XC2
had modest increases in overall uptake compared to CLIP6, but
required some energy-dependent process for cell entry that was not
clathrin-mediated. Again, this signifies something unique about turn
residues of CLIP6. In addition to being less toxic than its natural turncontaining counterparts, CLIP6 has energy-independent cell entry for
small molecule delivery that is indicative of direct translocation across
the cell membrane. This further supports the notion that the turn of
CLIP6 is imparting some local conformational bias that is affecting
activity. Nonetheless, the overall general trend appears to be that
peptides capable of folding at the cell surface can better enter cells,
but this same folding potential also increases their lytic behavior.
Less-folded peptides are less toxic, but as CPPs they enter cells less
efficiently and are more able to evade clathrin-mediated endocytosis,
at least with respect to the delivery of small molecule cargo (such as
fluorescein).
3.2 | EGFP-CPP fusions can be generated and can
enter cells
After evaluating the CPP properties of the natural turn-containing peptides in the absence of protein cargo, we then directed our efforts
toward intracellular protein delivery using EGFP derivatives that contain these new sequences fused to their C-terminus (Figures 3A and
S3). Fluorescent proteins are useful models for intracellular delivery
because their uptake efficiency and localization can be easily monitored by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy.[26,38–40] The initial
unmodified EGFP vector we obtained contained a noncleavable Histag at the protein's N-terminus (EGFP within the pDest527 vector).
Since poly-His has been shown to have mild CPP behavior,[41] His-tag
removal would allow for a more accurate assessment of our CPPs for
mediating protein uptake. Therefore, in addition to the C-terminal CPP
domains, we also incorporated an N-terminal protease cleavage site for
His-tag removal. Pilot expressions were conducted to find optimized
conditions, with reduced temperature (17 C) and IPTG concentrations
(0.5 mM) typically leading to the greatest yields of fluorescently active
protein. The expression of His-EGFP-XC analogs led to purified yields
of up to 10 mg per L culture. The EGFP-XS analogs required further
optimization because the initial vector used for expression (pDest527)
resulted in His-tagged constructs with pIs close to the optimal pH (~8)
needed for immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC). This
prohibitively reduced the EGFP-XS solubility after bacterial cell lysis (-
Figure S4A). To circumvent this issue, we then cloned the XS
sequences into a His-MBP-containing vector (pDest566) for improved
solubility (Figures S3 and S4B), which afforded His-MBP-EGFP-XS2 in
yields of ~10 mg per L culture. However, the EGFP-XS1 constructs
were unable to produce acceptable yields of soluble, fluorescently
active material. We hypothesize that this is due to XS1's increased
folding capability and subsequent lytic behavior when compared to the
other CPPs containing natural turns. Since fusions containing lytic peptide domains can hinder bacterial cell growth and overall protein production, these troublesome sequences often require post-expression
conjugation for attaching to proteins of interest.[29,42,43] Additionally,
EGFP folding and maturation is a relatively slow process.[44,45] It is possible that after protein expression, sequences with strong β-sheet propensities like XS1 could interpolate into the fluorescent protein domain
and disrupt formation of the proper β-barrel structure. This would not
only inhibit chromophore maturation and fluorescence, but could also
lead to aggregation induced insolubility. Although we could not generate EGFP-XS1, milligram quantities of protein were readily obtained for
the other EGFP-CPP conjugates and all underwent efficient His-tag
removal (Figure 3B).
We then conducted flow cytometry to quantify CPP-mediated
protein delivery into A549 cells. XS2 was significantly better at delivering EGFP than either of the two XC analogs (Figure 4A, Table S2).
This suggests that within our family of β-hairpin-inspired CPPs,
sequences that adopt folded conformations and that more readily
engage the cell surface are most suited for macromolecular delivery.[21,22] All of the EGFP-CPP conjugates were more dependent on
clathrin-mediated endocytosis than the analogous peptides tagged
with a small molecule fluorescent dye (Figure 2C), which highlights
the major hurdle for therapeutic translation of many CPPs with
respect to macromolecular delivery. Intracellular protein delivery was
studied further for EGFP-XS2 using confocal microscopy (Figure 4B).
Substantial amounts of protein were localized within punctate vesicles, indicative of endocytic uptake, with weakly diffuse fluorescence
demonstrating that some protein reached the cytoplasm. In contrast,
EGFP void of the CPP fusion was not taken up by the cells, indicating
that the CPP was crucial for delivery. These results show that even
though endosomal entrapment is a concern, intracellular protein delivery can be accomplished with our β-hairpin-inspired CPPs and lays the
foundation for future designs that could improve these up efforts.

4 | CONCLUSIONS
We have taken two previously developed CPPs and modified the
composition of their central β-turn domain to replace the non-natural
sequence (containing D-proline) with natural turns that are amenable
to standard protein expression. These changes within the turn region
not only affect the way the peptides fold and interact with the surface
of negatively charged membranes, but ultimately impact a variety of
important CPP-related properties such as cytotoxicity, total uptake,
and mechanism of cell entry. We then designed and generated
expression constructs that directly fused the natural turn-containing
CPPs to EGFP and demonstrated intracellular protein delivery. As one
might expect, the uptake mechanisms for these new CPPs differ
depending on whether the attached cargo is a small molecule or a protein, with the later even more reliant on endocytosis. Intuitively, this
seems reasonable since it should be difficult for a large protein to
enter a cell via direct translocation without compromising cell membrane integrity. In general, endosomal entrapment limits the therapeutic potential of most CPP-based delivery approaches. One possible
strategy forward may include the incorporation of domains that facilitate rapid escape from endosomes.[36,46,47] In addition to these possible design modifications, we are currently working toward sequence
optimizations within our family of CPPs that reduce the toxicity of our
well-folded β-hairpins (SVS1-like derivatives) and improve the overall
uptake of the intrinsically disordered peptides (CLIP6-like derivatives),
both of which could further improve the efficiency of cytosolic protein delivery.
