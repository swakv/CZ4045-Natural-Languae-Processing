Introduction Cancer remains the second leading cause of death in the United States, following cardiovascular disease [1]. Due to the development of single drug resistance and dose-limiting toxicities with traditional chemotherapy and tumor heterogeneity, combination chemotherapy is commonly used in the clinic to treat many late-stage cancer subtypes [2–6]. While patients' tumors often respond to combination chemotherapy, overall efficacy is limited due to increased toxicity [7]. In an attempt to increase the overall efficacy and reduce toxicity, drug delivery systems (DDS) carrying various combinations of chemotherapeutic agents have been engineered and tested [8• ,9]. Such systems can improve the bioavailability of chemotherapeutics, and deliver precise ratios of the agents directly to the cancer site. Liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles, polymeric micelles, and polymer drug conjugates (PDCs) designed to carry combinations of chemotherapy agents have shown better efficacy in preclinical models compared to free drug combinations. Furthermore, VYXEOS™ (CPX-351), a liposomal formulation carrying daunorubicin and cytarabine, significantly extended patient survival over the standard care in a phase III clinical trial while treating secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Of all systems engineered thus far to deliver chemotherapy agents, PDCs are unique and offer multiple advantages. Instead of physical encapsulation, drugs are chemically conjugated to a polymer, and the drug ratio and subsequent release rates are governed by the chemistry used to incorporate the drugs. While few combination PDCs have entered the clinic, the activity of single agent PDCs in clinical trials, most notably the ability to decrease toxicity, give rise to further motivation in continuing the development of PDC-based combination chemotherapy [10–15]. As discussed in a 2009 review [16• ], designing an effective combination chemotherapy with PDCs is a significant challenge due to the large design space involving chemistry, biology, and materials science. Here, we briefly summarize the polymers and chemistries that have been used to incorporate single agents and briefly discuss recent clinical translation. We then thoroughly review the various types of combination PDCs that have been tested recently both in vitro and in vivo and evaluate their biological performance based upon physiochemical properties. Lastly, we offer recommendations on future combination PDC development, with an emphasis on clinical translation. 2. Polymers in PDCs Macromolecular-based drug carriers have evolved continuously since Ehrlich proposed the idea of a “magic bullet” in 1906. The development of polymeric carriers for non-cancer drugs [17–20] laid the foundation for Helmut Ringsdorf's clear model for delivering drugs using pharmacologically active polymers in 1975 [21]. Since then, a variety of PDC systems have been engineered to deliver chemotherapeutic agents and have been studied extensively in vivo [22–27]. PDCs offer many advantages to traditional chemotherapy by manipulating the properties of the drug. For example, conjugating a small molecule drug to a polymer can improve the drug's solubility in water, protect it from systemic degradation, and increase drug circulation time. In addition, macromolecular carriers with extended Current Opinion in Colloid & Interface Science 31 (2017) 75–85 ⁎ Corresponding author. E-mail address: mitragotri@seas.harvard.edu (S.

While each polymer-drug system has its own physical characteristics, a few general trends have been observed in the field. For example, studies have shown that polymers with a higher molecular weight tend to circulate longer in the plasma due to reduced renal clearance rates, and can accumulate higher at the tumor [33,34]. Furthermore, there are multiple structural factors which impact conjugate performance including polymer architecture and chemical linkers, which is summarized in the following review [35]. With the goal of reducing systemic toxicity while still achieving tumor regression, a wide range of natural and synthetic water-soluble polymers have been evaluated in the first generation of polymer therapeutics and its subsequent clinical testing. Here, we will briefly discuss the polymers used in these conjugates, with an emphasis on the advantages of each polymer platform. A summary of the PDCs tested in the clinic can be found in Table 1. 2.1. HPMA copolymer-drug conjugates Although a synthetic polymer, N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer is the most versatile and greatly explored polymer used in PDCs. HPMA is highly soluble in water, nontoxic, nonimmunogenic, and capable of circulating in the blood for extended periods due to non-adsorption of plasma proteins [36]. HPMA copolymer synthesis has evolved from the free radical polymerization of comonomers of HPMA and methacrylated (MA)-peptidyl-nitrophenylester (ONp) to the polymerization of derivatives of drugs, such as (MA)- peptidyl-drug [36,37••,38]. Although non-biodegradable, HPMA-drug conjugates with a molecular weight (MW) b40 kDA can be eliminated from the body via renal filtration. Further, multi-block degradable HPMA conjugates have been designed to allow for larger constructs to be administered systemically and still be cleared [39]. Various HPMA products have been evaluated in clinical trials, including conjugates carrying doxorubicin (DOX), paclitaxel (PTX), camptothecin (CPT), and dichloro(1,2-diaminocyclohexane)platinum(II) (DACHPt, the oxaliplatin parent complex) [13,15,40,41]. In all of the trials, 20 to 30 kDa HPMA copolymers were used with the peptide cleavable linker GFLG or acid labile linkers. In addition, a targeting ligand was also evaluated by conjugating both galactosamine and DOX to HPMA (PK2) [42]. The majority of the phase I and II clinical trials reported acceptable toxicity with partial responses during treatment of various cancers. All conjugates reported improved drug bioavailability and tolerable toxicity profiles, and the conjugate carrying DACHPt (ProLindac) has shown promising clinical results. Phase I/II clinical evaluation of ProLindac in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer demonstrated an excellent safety profile and antitumor efficacy. Subsequently, a multicenter-based evaluation of ProLindac in combination with Paclitaxel (PTX) is being pursued in Europe for treatment of late stage ovarian cancer [43]. 2.2. Polysaccharide–drug conjugates Polysaccharide-based systems are highly attractive due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and synthesis costs. Polysaccharides are soluble in water and have various functional groups to conjugate drugs. Due to their ability to be degraded naturally, higher MW conjugates can be administered to enhance plasma retention times. In addition, certain polysaccharides are capable of specifically binding to cancer cells, such as hyaluronic acid (HA) which binds to CD44 (a cell surface receptor that is highly expressed on cancer cells). Polysaccharide-drug conjugates that have entered clinical trials were primarily based upon hyaluronic acid (HA), dextran (DEX), and cyclodextrin. Many of these conjugates, including AD-70 (oxDEXDOX), DE-310 (cmDEX-exatecan), and MEN 4901/T-0128 (cmDEX-T2513) showed excellent response rates, but severe toxicity limited the treatments [44–46]. A paclitaxel conjugate with HA administered with intravesical therapy showed excellent efficacy while treating bladder cancer locally [47]. In addition, a β-cyclodextrin-PEG copolymer with CPT (CRLX-101) is currently being evaluated for treating various types of cancers in phase 2 trials due to promising phase 1 results [12]. 2.3. PEG-drug conjugates Poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) is a commercial polymer widely used in FDA-approved biological applications. Due to its hydrophilic nature and Table 1 Summary of single drug PDCs evaluated in the clinic.

PEG-conjugates with MW in the range of 20–50 kDa can avoid renal elimination, and nanoparticles formed from PEG with MW (2–5 kDa) circulate in the blood longer and avoid hepatic clearance [48]. In the clinic, drugs have been conjugated directly to the ends of single and multi-arm PEG and to block-copolymers containing PEG, which typically self-assemble into micelles. PEG conjugates of CPT and active metabolites of CPT including Irinotecan (CPT-11) and SN38 were evaluated in clinical trials [49–51]. In PROTHECAN (PEG-CPT), CPT is conjugated to both ends of PEG with glycine spacers, while in EZN-2208 (PEG-SN38) and NKTR-102 (PEGCPT-11), four drug molecules are conjugated to 4-arm PEG polymers. In all of the clinical studies, conjugation to PEG significantly increased drug bioavailability, and the PEG-drug constructs showed partial responses in the trials. Various amphiphilic block copolymers of PEG-polypeptides were also tested in the clinical setting. DOX (NK911) and epirubicin (EPI) (NC-6300) were conjugated to PEG-b-poly(aspartic acid) which selfassemble into 40 nm and 60 nm micelles, respectively [52,53]. Similarly, SN38 was conjugated to PEG-b-poly(L-glutamic acid) with an ester bond, forming 20 nm micelles (NK012) [54]. In addition, the platinum drugs Cisplatin (CIS) and DACHPt were conjugated to PEG-b-poly(Lglutamic acid) with Pt coordination linkers (NC6004 and NC4016, respectively) forming micelles of approximately 30 nm [10,55]. Having demonstrated good tolerability and acceptable efficacy in early clinical studies, NC6004 is now being tested in combination with gemcitabine (GEM) for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer in a phase 3 study. 2.4. PG-drug conjugates Poly(α, L-glutamic acid) (PG) is a naturally occurring polypeptide composed of repeating units of L-glutamic acid. The polymer is highly soluble in water due to a negative charge that exists at neutral pH on the pendent free carboxyl group in each repeating unit of glutamic acid. PG is biocompatible and can undergo lysosomal degradation. It is primarily cleared via renal pathways with limited involvement of the reticuloendothelial system. The poorly soluble drugs PTX and CPT have been conjugated to PG and evaluated in clinical trials, as XYOTAX and CT-2106, respectively [14,56,57]. PTX and CPT were conjugated to 39 kDa and 49 kDa PG, respectively, with an ester bond. Both drugs showed a significant increase in plasma half-life upon conjugation with better tolerability than the single drugs. 2.5. Pros/cons of PDC classes With regard to delivering combinations of chemotherapeutic agents, each polymer class has specific advantages. The synthesis of HPMA has been developed to precisely control the amount of each drug on the polymer backbone, enabling fine control of drug ratio and final conjugate chemical structure; however, the polymer is non-biodegradable requiring multi-block polymers to avoid renal filtration. Both polysaccharides and PG have many functional handles to conjugate multiple drugs and are degraded naturally in the body; however, the chemistry is not as developed. PEG can increase drug circulation and drug solubility significantly; however, drugs can only be conjugated to the ends of PEG, often requiring block-copolymers of PEG or branched PEG to conjugate multiple drugs to the same polymer backbone. 3. Applications of combination treatment with PDCs The advantages of using polymer therapeutics, such as improved drug circulation and drug bioavailability, have been demonstrated in many preclinical and clinical studies. However, tumor cells can develop resistance to single drug therapy, minimizing treatment efficacy of polymer therapeutics carrying a single drug. To more effectively inhibit tumor growth, treatments can be designed to use PDCs to deliver a combination of chemotherapeutic agents. This section focuses on the recent, preclinical work with combination chemotherapy platforms containing PDCs. While the focus here is to only discuss combination DDS which have at least one drug chemically conjugated to a polymeric carrier, there are systems that have drugs physically loaded, and the reader is referred to these recent review articles for more details [8• ,9]. As originally discussed in the review by Greco et al. [16• ], there are many ways to incorporate PDCs into a combination chemotherapy platform. Most simply, two single drug PDCs can be administered simultaneously or at different time points. However, it may be advantageous for the drugs to circulate together, in which case a single delivery vehicle should be used. This vehicle can be a self-assembled structure of a single drug PDC with an adsorbed drug, a self-assembled structure of multiple single drug PDCs, or a polymer with multiple drugs conjugated to the same polymer backbone. Examples of these differences are shown schematically in Fig. 1. Here, we focus on the preclinical studies which have used PDCs to combine multiple small molecule drugs into a single therapy. First, we discuss the carriers which deliver synergistic drug pairs to selectively target various types of cancers. We then discuss the use of combination PDCs to overcome single drug resistance and conclude with examples of PDC systems which have been designed to improve targeting to the tumor site. These studies are summarized in Table 2. 3.1. Synergy with combinations containing platinum based drugs Platinum drugs, most commonly CIS, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin, are used in approximately 50% of all cancer treatment. However, due to severe toxicity, the drugs are often combined with other chemotherapeutic agents in the clinic to lower effective doses. To further reduce systemic toxicity, many PDCs have been designed to deliver platinum drugs with other chemotherapeutic classes. Platinum drugs are commonly combined with anthracyclines to treat advanced gastric cancer [59,60]. Two micellar PDCs which were evaluated in the clinic (NC-6300 and NC-4016) have been combined to deliver EPI and oxaliplatin simultaneously in mice models [61]. In NC-6300, EPI is conjugated to PEG-polyasparate with a hydrazone bond forming micelles approximately 40–80 nm in diameter [53]. NC-4016, a self-assembled micelle (40 nm), consists of a PEGpolyglutamate complex with DACHPt. Consistent with the free drug combination, the combination of NC-6300 and NC-4016 is synergistic while treating the human gastric cancer cell 44As3Luc in vitro. The synergy was also evident in vivo, as the PDC combination was more effective than the individual PDCs at inhibiting tumor growth in both a s/c and an orthotopic 44As3Luc tumor model. In addition, the use of PDCs increased the AUC of both drugs in the tumor by a factor of 2.1 and 3.7 for EPI and oxaliplatin, respectively. This led to improved tumor reduction and less leukopenia and anemia in the mice treated with PDCs compared to those treated with free drugs. PDC platforms have also delivered platinum drugs with anthracyclines to treat other cancers. Self-assembled nanoparticles (158.7 ± 3.3 nm), containing transferrin-PEG-adipic acid dihydrazide-DOX (hydrazone linkage) and PLGA-CIS (ester linkage), were used to treat hepatocellular carcinoma [62]. While treating HepG2 cells in vitro, the combination particles were synergistic at a molar ratio of 5:1 DOX:CIS. The combination particles were more effective at treating a subcutaneous, HepG2 xenograft than the individual micelles and the free drug combination. Similarly, DOX and CIS were conjugated to independent HA polymers (35 kDa) to treat breast cancer in vivo [63]. Local injections of HA-DOX and HA-CIS eradicated the tumor in an orthotopic tumor model (MDA-MB-468LN), while the free drug combination induced body weight loss and did not permanently stop disease progression. D.R. Vogus et al. / Current Opinion in Colloid & Interface Science 31 (2017) 75–85 77 Combining taxanes with platinum based drugs is also commonly used to treat ovarian cancer [64–67]. Xiao et al. conjugated both PTX and CIS to mPEG-b-P(LA-co-MCC-OH) block copolymers [68]. The individual PDCs self-assembled into micelles in PBS (224 nm). The combination micelles of CIS and PTX were synergistic in inhibiting ovarian cancer cell (SKOV-3) growth across various molar ratios, consistent with the free drug data. The combination micelles were more effective at inhibiting tumor growth in a subcutaneous, cervical cancer model (U14), than each individual micelle verifying the synergy between the two drugs. While a higher dose of PTX and CIS were required in the combination micelles to inhibit tumor growth than the free drugs, there was significantly less cardio and liver toxicity than the free drug combination. In a final example, the chemotherapeutic agent dimethylcantharidin (DMC) is conjugated to a cisplatin (CIS) analogue with an ester bond, and the resulting compound is then conjugated to a PEG-b-P(LA-coMCC/OH) block copolymer [69]. The vehicle undergoes self-assembly into micelles approximately 200–280 nm in size. The combination conjugate (P-DMC-CIS) is slightly synergistic at inhibiting growth of liver cancer cells (H22) in vitro and is much more effective at inhibiting subcutaneous H22 growth in vivo than the single drug micelles. In addition, mice treated with P-DMC-CIS showed no body weight loss, while those treated with free CIS lost approximately 15% body weight. 3.2. Synergy with combinations of topoisomerase inhibitors Combinations of topoisomerase inhibitors have shown moderate efficacy in the clinic; however, treatments are limited due to toxicity [70–73]. PDCs have been synthesized to simultaneously deliver various derivatives of CPT with DOX in an attempt to reduce systemic toxicity. Due to the hydrophobicity of each drug, the combination vehicle will often self-assemble into a larger structure. The benefits of incorporating DOX and CPT into the same vehicle is shown by Wei et al. DOX is conjugated to the block copolymer PBAPEG-ss-PCL with a hydrazone bond, and 10-hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) is incorporated via π-π stacking during the self-assembly of micelles (81.9 ± 4.2 nm), shown in Fig. 2 [74]. The micelles are tested on drug resistant breast cancer cells (MCF-7/ADR), and the results revealed increased toxicity and apoptosis compared to free drugs. In vivo, the micellar formulation circulated longer than DOX (15 fold) and CPT (6 fold), and was more effective at inhibiting tumor growth in a MCF-7/ADR s/c tumor model than micelles containing the single drugs and the free drug combination. Other studies have conjugated DOX and CPT to polysaccharide carriers. CPT and DOX, were conjugated to HA with an ester and ester/ amide bond, respectively [78]. The combination of CPT and DOX was extremely synergistic (CI b 0.10) in inhibiting HER2+ breast cancer cell growth (BT-474), at an optimal molar ratio of 4.5:1 CPT:DOX after conjugation (compared to any molar ratio N2:1 prior to conjugation). While the combination conjugate (HA-CPT-DOX) was less effective than the free drug combination at inhibiting tumor growth in a syngeneic 4T1 tumor model, the tumor cells had higher apoptosis activity after treatment with the conjugates. Additionally, DOX and CPT were conjugated to dextran (DEX) with a disulfide and hydrazone bond, respectively [79]. The PDCs self-assemble into a combination Fig. 1. Cartoon schematic of the physical structures of polymer drug conjugates (PDCs) used to deliver combinations of small molecule chemotherapeutic agents. 78 D.R. Vogus et al. / Current Opinion in Colloid & Interface Science 31 (2017) 75–85 micelle in DI water (186 nm). The combination micelles are synergistic on murine breast cancer cells (4T1) at CPT:DOX ratios ranging from 1:4 to 4:1. The combination micelle (injected intraperitoneal) was slightly more effective at inhibiting tumor growth in a 4T1 tumor model compared to the free drug combination. 3.3. Other synergistic combinations The combination of DOX with antimetabolites is commonly employed to treat various types of cancer, and various attempts have been made to incorporate DOX and GEM into a single delivery vehicle. DOX and GEM were conjugated to m-PEG-PLA copolymers with a hydrazone and amide bond, respectively. The PDCs self-assemble into a micelle that is 170–190 nm in diameter. The combination micelle is synergistic in inhibiting tumor growth in vitro on both HepG2 and MCF-7 cells [80]. In addition, DOX and GEM were also conjugated to HPMA with the GFLG peptide [81]. The copolymer (HPMA-DOX-GEM) was more effective at inhibiting prostate tumor (Dunning AT1) growth in vivo than the combination of free drugs and physical mixture of individual PDCs. Taxanes are also commonly combined with DOX to treat metastatic breast cancer [82]. Many attempts have been made to incorporate DOX and PTX or DTX onto a single polymeric carrier. For example, DOX and PTX, were conjugated to PG with a hydrazone and ester bond, respectively [83••]. The free drug combination and combination conjugate (P-DOX-PTX) was synergistic at inhibiting both ovarian cancer (ES-2) and breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cell growth in vitro. The combination conjugate (P-DOX-PTX) was significantly more effective at inhibiting tumor growth in an orthotopic, MDA-MB-231 tumor model than the physical combination of individual PDCs and free drugs. While no weight loss was observed for the mice treated with P-DOX-PTX, mice treated with the free drugs did experience weight loss. Additional PDC studies have incorporated DOX and taxanes, and they will be discussed in upcoming sections. 3.4. Overcoming drug resistance A significant challenge associated with mono-chemotherapy is the development of drug resistance. The resistance can be specific to a single drug, or to a large class of chemotherapeutics, often due to the over-expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) pumps which pump out small molecule drugs. PDCs can help overcome drug resistance through various mechanisms. Conjugation to a polymer can eliminate drug efflux from P-gp pumps. In addition, sensitivity to a specific drug can be restored by delivering another drug simultaneously with the PDC which re-sensitizes the cell. Taxanes are commonly used for treating advanced prostate cancer; however, cells often develop taxane resistance [84–86]. Cyclopamine (CYP), a hedgehog inhibitor, is effective at preventing and reverting this resistance; however, its poor water solubility limits its utility [87]. To overcome this limitation, docetaxel (DTX) and CYP were conjugated to independent HPMA polymers with the commonly used peptide GFLG [88]. The combination of P-DTX and P-CYP was more effective than single drug PDCs at inhibiting long term growth of prostate cancer (PC-3 cells) in vitro and in an in vivo subcutaneous tumor model. The improved efficacy was attributed to the ability to target both taxane resistant and non-resistant cancer cells simultaneously. In another example, paclitaxel (PTX) and CYP were each conjugated to the block copolymer m-PEG-b-PCC through an ester and amide linkage, respectively, and both single drug PDCs self-assembled into micelles approximately 70 nm in size [89]. The physical combination of P-PTX and P-CYP inhibited the proliferation of taxane resistant prostate cancer cells Table 2 Summary of combination PDC preclinical studies.

Vogus et al. / Current Opinion in Colloid & Interface Science 31 (2017) 75–85 79 (DU145-TXR and PC3-TXR) in vitro and in an orthotopic prostate tumor model (PC3). DOX resistant cells were also effectively treated with a combination PDC. DOX and mitomycin C (MMC) were conjugated to the polysaccharide xyloglucan (XG) with the enzyme cleavable, peptide linker GLG [90]. Both the conjugates and free drugs were evaluated in treating liver cancer in DOX-resistant hepatoma cells (HepG2/DOX). The combination polymer (P-DOX-MMC) was more effective at inhibiting tumor growth in vitro than the physical combination of individual PDCs at molar ratios of MMC:DOX ranging from 0.5:1 to 2.5:1. In a subcutaneous HepG2/DOX in vivo model, the combination polymer (P-DOX-MMC) extended mouse survival by over 20 d compared to the free drug combination and was more effective at inhibiting tumor growth than the physical mixture of individual PDCs (P-DOX + P-MMC). Cells over expressing P-gp develop a resistance to all types of chemotherapeutics; however, P-gp inhibitors can inhibit this resistance. HPMA copolymers containing anthracyclines and P-gp inhibitors have been synthesized, as shown in Fig. 2 [75]. Two anthracyclines (DOX and pirarubicin (THP)) and two P-gp inhibitors (reversin 121 (REV) and ritonavir (RIT)) were conjugated to HPMA with hydrazone bonds. The study showed that physically giving a polymer containing REV or RIT prior to the polymer containing DOX or THP was more effective at inhibiting neuroblastoma cell growth in vitro than the polymers containing both a P-gp inhibitor and an anthracycline. It was hypothesized that pretreatment with the P-gp inhibitor is more effective due to earlier P-gp inhibition compared to giving both drugs on the same polymer. Furthermore, Duan et al. synthesized a poly(styrene-comaleic anhydride) conjugate with DOX which self-assembled into micelles and entrapped disulfiram (DSF), another P-gp inhibitor [91]. The micelles, which released DSF quicker, were effective at treating multi-drug resistant cancer cells (MCF-7/ADR) in vivo. Similarly, Wei et al. showed that MCF-7/ADR cells could be treated with a conjugate containing DOX and CPT, as discussed previously [74]. Despite the drug resistance, a high concentration of both DOX and CPT was observed in the nucleus when delivered with the combination PDC. The authors hypothesized that both the polymer construct and the released drugs (which interact via π-π stacking) were able to evade efflux pumps. 3.5. Targeting tumor sites In addition to delivering multiple cytotoxic drugs, polymer carriers can carry therapeutics which either improve tumor targeting or manipulate the vasculature near the tumor. For example, the clinical product PK2 (HPMA-DOX-galactosamine), used galactosamine to specifically target the PDC to liver cells. Here, we focus on a few preclinical studies in which a PDC is used to deliver a cytotoxic drug with another small molecule with a different therapeutic function. There are also many examples of PDCs which deliver a nucleic acid, protein, or peptide with a small molecule drug to improve cancer cell sensitivity or carrier targeting, and the reader is referred the following reviews for more details about these PDCs [92,93]. Wang et al. demonstrated the usefulness of forming a combination PDC which targets the tumor vasculature along with the tumor cells [94]. PTX is conjugated to mPEG-PLA via an ester bond, and Combretastatin A4 (CA4) is incorporated into the vehicle through adsorption during the nanoprecipitation of micelles (68.3 ± 1.4 nm). CA4 is released relatively faster than PTX because it is just physically Fig. 2. Examples of therapeutic benefits gained using combination therapy with PDCs.

The combination vehicle was moderately more effective at inhibiting tumor growth than single drug micelles in a subcutaneous, Lewis lung carcinoma model; however, its efficacy is not compared to the combination of free drugs. Alendronate (ALN), commonly used to treat osteoporosis, has been combined with PTX in various studies to specifically target bone metastases in breast cancer. In one example, PTX and ALN are conjugated to HPMA with the GFLGFK and GFLG peptide linkers, respectively [95, 96]. ALN had no impact on toxicity of PTX in vitro on MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 breast cancer cells. However, the combination conjugate (P-ALNPTX) was more effective at inhibiting 4T1 tumor growth in the tibia and less toxic than the combination of free drugs. In a different system, ALN was conjugated to a PEG dendrimer with an amide bond, while PTX was conjugated to the other tail of PEG with an ester bond, as shown in Fig. 2 [76,77]. The amphiphilic polymer self-assembled into micelles (~200 nm). Again, ALN had no toxicity in vitro, but the combination conjugate (P-ALN-PTX) was more effective than free drugs at targeting tumor within the bone marrow while inhibiting its growth in both a syngeneic (4 T1) and human xenograft (MDA-MB-231) mammary, bone metastasis tumor model. 3.6. Other types of combination therapy Chemotherapy has been combined with other therapies using PDCs to improve efficacy. For example, chemotherapy was combined with endocrine therapy by conjugating both DOX and aminoglutethimide (AGM) to HPMA with the GFLG peptide [97,98]. HPMA-DOX-AGM was more effective at inhibiting ER+/PR+ breast cancer cell growth (MCF7) in vitro than the physical mixture of HPMA-DOX and HPMA-AGM, demonstrating the benefits of conjugating both drugs to the same polymer. Furthermore, PDCs have delivered chemotherapeutic agents in combination with photosensitizers to combine chemotherapy with photodynamic therapy, which is discussed in the following review [36]. Other interesting combination treatments have also been developed to reduce toxicity. In one example, a PEG conjugate carrying EPI and molecules which release nitric oxide (NO) was synthesized to reduce the cardiac toxicity associated with EPI [99,100]. The conjugate (EPIPEG-NO) was more effective at inhibiting the growth of SKOV-2 and Caco-2 tumor xenografts while eliciting less cardiac toxicity compared to free EPI and EPI-PEG. Although not discussed in detail here, various combination therapies with PDCs have also been developed to allow for a more efficient release of the chemotherapeutic agent at the tumor site. For example, a PDC carrying a chemotherapeutic agent can be combined with a PDC carrying an enzyme which degrades the drug linker in polymer-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (PDEPT) [101,102]. 4. Critical design parameters When incorporating multiple therapeutics into a single PDC treatment, there are many design parameters that need to be addressed, such as sequence of administration, drug ratio, and vehicle structure. While the majority of the studies in the field show the benefits of using the combination treatment compared to single drug therapy, there are few which try to understand the various aspects of the combination treatment that impact the efficacy. Each drug combination will have its individual dependence upon these factors; however, there are a few general ideas that can be gathered by analyzing these studies. 4.1. Physical combination compared to dual construct The first design parameter to address is whether or not it is satisfactory to physically mix together single drug PDCs, or if further therapeutic benefits can be obtained by incorporating multiple therapeutics into the same delivery vehicle. It is much simpler to physically combine single drug PDCs from a regulatory standpoint, and it allows for more flexibility in changing drug ratio and schedule for a given patient. However, it is often advantageous to have both drugs accumulate at the tumor simultaneously, which can only be guaranteed if both drugs are conjugated to the same polymer backbone. While often neglected, the relative release rate of each drug from the combination PDC can also be adjusted based on the intended interaction between the two drugs; however, this adds another layer of complexity to the design of a combination PDC. Studies which have demonstrated benefits to physically combining single drug PDCs or using a combination PDC are now discussed. Many studies have shown that using a combination conjugate is more effective than the physical mixture of single drug PDCs because both drugs are delivered simultaneously to the tumor site. For example, Makovsky et al. clearly demonstrated the improved therapeutic benefits of the dual construct PG-PTX-DOX compared to the physical mixture of PG-PTX and PG-DOX (Fig. 3) [83••]. Furthermore, other studies have demonstrated the importance of controlling drug ratio on polymer backbone to maximize synergy and minimize administration dose, using the Chou-Talalay method [62,78,79,103]. Interestingly, the optimal drug ratio can change upon conjugation to a polymeric carrier due to new drug availability kinetics. For example, Camacho et al. have shown that the internalization of CPT and DOX is drastically different after conjugation to HA, leading to differences the subcellular location and concentration of each drug [78]. On the contrary, a significant benefit of physically mixing together single drug PDCs is the ability to easily optimize the administration sequence of the carriers (Fig. 3). Zhang et al. demonstrated that giving paclitaxel (PTX) prior to gemcitabine (GEM) is more synergistic than other administration schedules at inhibiting growth of A2780 ovarian cancer cells in vitro [37••]. Both drugs were conjugated to independent, mono-block HPMA polymers (40–50 kDa) and degradable, di-block HPMA polymers (100–110 kDa) with the GFLG peptide linker. Administering the di-block P-PTX prior to diblock P-GEM is more effective at inhibiting tumor growth in a subcutaneous A2780 tumor model in vivo than the same drug combination schedule with free GEM and PTX and single block P-GEM and P-PTX. This improvement in efficacy is consistent with an increase in circulation time of the di-block HPMA conjugates. A recent study tested higher molecular weight P-PTX and P-GEM HPMA co-polymers, but still found that di-block co-polymers (~100 kDa) were most effective at treating the A2780 tumor model [38]. They also reported good efficacy when sequentially administering di-block P-PTX prior to di-block P-GEM. Similarly, another report demonstrated that giving GEM prior to DACHPt was more effective at inhibiting A2780 tumor growth in vitro [105]. Using di-block HPMA conjugates of both drugs, giving P-GEM prior to P-DACHPt was more effective at inhibiting tumor growth than the reverse sequence, consistent with the free drug data. 4.2. Vehicle structure While there are a plethora of studies which show the benefits of using a polymeric carrier to deliver a combination of drugs compared to free drug administration, few studies compare how effective the particular carrier is to other possible carriers. Variables such as the effect of the vehicle structure (size, drug loading, etc.) and polymer properties (molecular weight, architecture, etc.) may play a role in affecting the performance in vivo. In this section, we focus on the few studies which explored how the physical architecture of a PDC with multiple drugs affects its efficacy in vitro and in vivo. In the first example, two combination PDCs, both carrying DOX and PTX were compared (Fig. 3) [104• ]. The first carrier consisted of linear PG conjugated to DOX and PTX (PG-PTX-DOX), discussed in detail previously [83••]. DOX and PTX were also conjugated with hydrazone bonds to the dendritic scaffold polyglycerol (PGlycerol), which was also PEGylated (PGlycerol-PTX-DOX-PEG). Both combination PDCs D.R. Vogus et al. / Current Opinion in Colloid & Interface Science 31 (2017) 75–85 81 were similar in size in aqueous buffer with a hydrodynamic radius of 41 nm (PG-PTX-DOX) and 24 nm (PGlycerol-PTX-DOX-PEG). Using a synergistic ratio of DOX and PTX (determined from in vitro studies), the combination PDCs demonstrated similar efficacies in treating a 4T1, subcutaneous tumor model and were more effective than the single drug PDCs. Surprisingly, the dendritic conjugate (PGlycerolPTX-DOX-PEG) was similar in efficacy to the physical combination of PGlycerol-PTX-PEG and PGlycerol-DOX-PEG, while the linear conjugate (PG-PTX-DOX) was much more effective than the physical combination of PG-PTX and PG-DOX. The authors hypothesize that the individual linear PDCs have different pharmacokinetic profiles, while the individual dendritic PDCs distribute similarly allowing for both drugs to reach the tumor site at the same time as with the combination conjugate. In a recent report, two HPMA conjugates carrying DOX and DTX with different architectures were directly compared [106••]. DOX and DTX were conjugated to both linear HPMA (~25 kDa) and degradable, dendritic HPMA (~ 250 kDa) with a hydrazone bond and levulinate linker, respectively. Both combinations of the linear PDCs and dendritic PDCs were approximately additive, while treating lymphoma cells (EL4) in vitro. In a subcutaneous EL4 tumor model, both linear P-DOX and dendritic P-DOX were extremely effective at inhibiting tumor growth. Interestingly, the physical combination of linear PDCs was slightly more effective than linear P-DOX, but the physical combination of dendritic PDCs was significantly less effective than dendritic P-DOX. Less dendritic P-DOX accumulates at the tumor site when administered with dendritic P-DTX, giving insight into the additive behavior between the dendritic PDCs in vivo. The authors hypothesize that the normalization of the blood vessels at the tumor site after DTX exposure, makes it more difficult for dendritic P-DOX (as opposed to linear P-DOX which is smaller) to accumulate at the tumor site with the EPR effect. This study clearly demonstrates that the interactions between drugs is not just limited to tumor cell toxicity but also to tumor accumulation. 5. Perspective on future development and conclusions The studies reviewed in sections 3 and 4 have demonstrated therapeutic benefits of using PDCs to deliver combinations of chemotherapeutic drugs in preclinical models; most notably, reduced toxicity and improved drug bioavailability compared to free drug administration in in vivo models. While these studies provide a great starting point for future PDC development, there are questions that need to be explored further for the continued advancement of the technology. More fundamental studies will provide the knowledge required to design effective combination therapies. First, the interactions between drugs need to be well characterized to engineer the most effective combination PDC therapy. Understanding how drug ratio and schedule impact the activity of a given drug combination will help guide PDC design. Furthermore, the development of novel chemical linkers can help fine-tune drug release kinetics to improve activity of a drug combination in vivo. Second, the material properties of the PDC need to be well controlled and characterized to understand how these parameters influence circulation and tumor targeting. Comparing different Fig. 3.

Vogus et al. / Current Opinion in Colloid & Interface Science 31 (2017) 75–85 polymeric systems carrying the same drug combinations will identify the most suitable carrier for a particular disease. Lastly, rigorous, clinically relevant models are necessary to truly evaluate the potential benefits of combination PDCs. This includes developing preclinical models that incorporate patient to patient variability in terms of tumor heterogeneity and multi-drug resistance. For future translation, the final construct must be well characterized. Extensive characterization of the chemical and physical properties of the PDC must be performed to validate the construct that advances to clinical development. It would be ideal if the synthesis of such constructs were not extremely complex. This would reduce the scale-up costs and support commercial viability, while overcoming the stringent regulatory approval process required for such multi-functional and multi-drug incorporated systems. Lastly, it is believed that PDCs will have a significant role in the future of combination chemotherapy. With continued contributions in material science, biology, and chemistry, combination PDCs can advance to the clinic for treatment of advanced malignancies with greater efficacy and reduced toxicity.
