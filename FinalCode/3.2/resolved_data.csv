"Visit:  Weekend Brunch, Saturday, Nov. 14, 2015

My friend and I arrived at 10:00am -- I believe we were the first ones to arrive. The staff, including those that I could see working in the open kitchen all appeared to be happy and in wonderful moods. friendly staff!

We ordered The Burger (cooked medium) with French Fries and The Portabella Burger (vegetarian) with a Salad.  And because the morning was nothing short of perfection, we sat outside on the veranda -- the outdoor seating area is large, overlooks the preserve, and has a fabulous view of the city.

The Burger is fantastic. The bread is soft, toasted, and buttery. The bacon is thick and crispy. The meat is of quality and was cooked perfectly. 

Feedback: great food
Feedback:  I would have liked a bit more hummus and the salad to have been a tad more substantial, it was a bit skimpy.

"The view is great. It is overlooking the strip from a vantage over the preserve. The food is quite simple and clean - particularly great for kids' palates. They can get random big rushes of tables, so I wouldn't recommend it if you are in a rush. 
P.S. they serve wine. great food. good ambience.","The view is great. The view is overlooking the strip from a vantage over the preserve.

"First time visitor this past Sunday.  I took my sister and mother here for their Mother's Day brunch.  Layout of the food was confusing.  Why would you put bacon with cold fruit and not with the hash browns and sausage?  Why would you not put a pan of scrambled eggs out?  Why would I have to stand in the omelet line for scrambled eggs?  Why does it take two ""chefs"" with 4-6 pans going at the same time over 7-10 minutes to make an omelet?  Why was I ignored after standing in line for an omelet?  Very disappointed, but willing to give this place another shot...but not anytime soon.","First time visitor this past Sunday.

"The Good:
excellent tasting food
healthy choices
reasonable prices
peaceful setting with great views, especially outside
great kids menu

The bad:
Try to avoid during kids field trip lunches for obvious reasons
they closed!  looking forward to the new opening...I hope they maintain the high quality and reasonable pricing.
the last few days they were open prior to shutting down was disgraceful...they really phoned it in.","The Good:

"One of the best museum Cafes around! My family and I really enjoy having lunch here after our regular visit to the Springs Preserve grounds & museums. I think they offer a nice variety of great food at fair prices. So far, I really haven't had anything Ive disliked. Have tried the burger, wedge salad with chicken, Cuban sandwich, chicken sandwich & Hawaiian teriyaki bowl. All good, fresh food & good portions. I have brought a few friends here who hadn't eaten at the cafe before & they were all pleasantly surprised. When the weather gets nice outside (spring & fall), we really like sitting outside & having lunch while enjoying the amazing views. Highly recommend checking it out.","One of the best museum Cafes around! My family and I really enjoy having lunch here after My family and I regular visit to the Springs Preserve grounds & museums.

"The restaurant did have a positive vibe. one of the most divine views in Las Vegas. The two places to enjoy the view are from inside and the patio. The inside is like a glass house where many tables are front row. good view.

I was impressed with the service. Immediately the friendly lady greeted me when I walked inside. friendly staff. I know that it is being freshly made. On another note, Divine Cafe is especially clean. good food. great ambience.

"Love this place. One of our secret ""locals"" spots. It's a cafe set up so nothing fancy but clean and comfy. The food is actually pretty damn good. great food. Better than average lunch places. Prices are about what you'd pay for a meal deal at some nasty fast food place $8 to $9. Big portions and pretty presentation. Fountian drinks and some infused waters and different flavored teas available for refreshments. 
It's a little hot during the summer but view is awesome. You can see the whole valley from the balcony. Highly recommend for businesses lunches or a quick meal out. Wish they were open longer but think they close at 3pm. Would be cool if they served dinner. good view! good drinks!","Love this place. One of our secret ""locals"" spots.

"I've been up here about 5 times now and the latest was when Springs Preserve held their Space exhibit.  What's not to love about this place.  good food, outdoor seating, great view of Springs Preserve with your meal and their menu is simple.  

Don't come here if you're looking for a fancy place with a good view.  The menu literally consists of only salads, burgers, sandwiches, and pizzas.  Oh they do serve alcohol though!  

The last thing I got here were the lobster rolls which was yummy.","I've been up here about 5 times now and the latest was when Springs Preserve held their Space exhibit.

"Talk about a hidden gem! My friend and I came here for happy hour recently. What a great view! The food was excellent, good drinks and service was fast and friendly. It's a little pricey, and they're only open for happy hour on Thursdays (for now), but hopefully both of those will change.

Sit on the patio (or inside to listen to live music), and soak up some nature while you're soaking up some good drinks. You won't be disappointed!!","Talk about a hidden gem!

"I absolutely love the ambiance. My kids love having lunch there, especially the crunchy tater tots. I personally enjoy the nicoise salad. When I lived in California I used to go to the Getty Museum every summer, but being here in Vegas now, the Springs preserve is the next best thing. Lastly, the outdoor Veranda is the perfect place to have lunch. The view is so relaxing. good food, good view!","I absolutely love the ambiance.

"Great Thursday evening happy hour, with live music.  Tonight, chilled to island style mellow tunes with bruddah Ryan and Iz, members of popular Vegas group, Haleamano.  There was good drinks, great food.  Can't beat the great view of the strip from the balcony.  ","Great Thursday evening happy hour, with live music.

"I love this cafe. 

The prices are expensive, but there is good food here, and I've been slowly working my way through the menu. They also serve good drinks if you want something like that while you eat. 

I can't forget to talk about the great view. Springs Preserve is gorgeous and, from the second floor, you can easily see the Strip in the distance. You can either sit inside the cafe or on the balcony.

There's also a happy hour every Thursday from 4 to 8pm that I've been meaning to go to because it looks awesome.

Divine Cafe is a hidden gem within Las Vegas that you should definitely try out when you get the chance.","I love Divine Cafe.

" Best snack ever! Perfect for me and my nephew. It was some excellent food. Also, there's a nice selection of unsweetened iced teas, a Coca-Cola freestyle machine, and berry infused water.

The dining area is so nice, clean, and spacious, with a great view of the Springs Preserve and in the distance, The Strip and a mountain range. I'm thinking Sunrise Mountains, but please correct me if I'm wrong.

"I love taking the kids and our visitors to the Springs regularly.  It's one of LV hidden treasures.  Having Divine Cafe makes it even better.  Don't have to make an extra stop or eat junk food prior to our day. A great family outing. We always lunch at the Divine Cafe before we start. The food is excellent and always fresh and hot.  The kids love how their food is served. I will leave this surprise for ur visit.  We made reservations for Mothers Day and was not disappointed. Omelets, pasta and sides were fresh and hot. I like my food very hot or crisp and cold!!! The steak was perfectly seasoned and tender. we tried several drinks that were consistently mixed the second time around!  The bacon was in a odd area but no crowd getting to it. The size of the desserts r perfect!  No waste for a perfect taste! The price is very affordable for the Brunch with a view to Make a perfect beginning or ending of ur day.  We look forward to another Brunch!","I love taking the kids and our visitors to the Springs regularly.  It's one of LV hidden treasures.  Having Divine Cafe makes Divine Cafe even better.

"Great spot for lunch. 
Great view of the strip. 
You order your food, they give you and number, pick your seat and wait.  
Friendly staff. 
I had the turkey melt with avocado-very good.  
Outdoor seating is available.","Great spot for lunch.

"New name and menu and improved food.  Checked our the restaurant at the Springs Preserve for the first time since the latest update.  I've eaten at the cafe 5-7 times over the years including when it was Wolfgang Puck and after as well.  I think this update is an improvement in both price and taste. We had 3 entrees and 3 kids meals for $44. My kids are 3,5,6 and the kids meals were a good amount of food for them asks included fresh fruit / veggies. The kids mac n cheese is yummy and the snack tray was perfect for my 3year old. The lobster sandwich special was awesome with the tomato bisque soup especially for $10. The service was so good although I've never had an issue on previous visits they just seemed a little more friendly this time. In the past the foods quality was hit or miss and a little overpriced. As a member that meant we normally skipped the café.  With this update we will definitely stop more often on our visits.","New name and menu and improved food.

"ABSOLETELY love the food here. Haven't ordered something we haven't liked. If I could give more stars I would. Service is absolutely excellent. Today I happened to leave my credit card without realizing. To my surprise, as I was leaving the parking lot our server was waiting for us. She flagged me down and returned my card to me. To me this is going above and beyond! I only wish I knew her name, but a big thank you for being so awesome! It isn't everyday someone would do that. Thank you to the whole staff for providing great good and service!","ABSOLETELY love the food here. Haven't ordered something we haven't liked. If I could give more stars I would.

"Divine Café is one of Vegas's best kept secrets for casual dining.  great view of beautiful Springs Preserve!  Where else in Vegas do you have a view of this many trees and beautiful greenery?  Awesome outside dining area!  I would recommend sitting out there if the weather is cooperating.  Springs Preserve is where Vegas started! History of this place is very cool!... But you can learn more about that when you go there :).  good food

Food is fresh and tasty, nice selection, kids menu and such great service!!  Everyone there was so incredibly friendly! friendly staff!

Personally, I don't follow football, but I know they Broadcast games and have specials during the games.  
I think they host wedding receptions and parties as well - pretty enough for it!  If you haven't been there yet, you should definitely check it out!!   Perfect place for business lunches!

Check hours ahead of time because I think it's primarily a breakfast and lunch place.","Divine Café is one of Vegas's best kept secrets for casual dining.  great view of beautiful Springs Preserve!

"The food was good. but the service was excellent. I and my 5 year old son and 11 year old daughter stopped by here for lunch after a fun experience at the museum and preserve. I ordered the tuna tataki, my son got the kids pizza, and my daughter got the kids mac and cheese.  

I was very impressed. My tuna tataki salad was very good...great view...and stellar service.","The food was good. but the service was excellent.

The springs cafe has changed. New name and new menu. A meal per person on average will cost $10. I ordered a hamburger and it fell apart.

"The menu was disappointing.
We are not a fan of some of the changes. It's cool you want to cater to the vegetarian crowd, but you replaced signature fresh made sandwiches with a frozen Impossible burger. It's trendy... It's brand name... It's garbage. Serve a fresh made veggie burger or a black bean burgers. Don't serve frozen GMO food... You're better than that. This isn't Burger King.
Salads also took a turn with this menu change. The new plates they come on make eating the salads precarious. You try to push a serving onto your fork, and push half the salad off the back of the plate. The bowls were better. Ingredients are lacking on these salads too. The Southwest salads was one of my favorites in town. The Vegas Chop is just as expensive with about half the ingredients. 
Speed and service were still good, and the view can't be beat.... But I'm not sure how quickly I'll be back with this menu.","The menu was disappointing.
