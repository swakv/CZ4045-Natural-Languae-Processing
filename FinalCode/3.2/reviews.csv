"Nice cafe for a snack or lunch.  Clean, organized and friendly staff.  We had 3 meat pizza large enough to serve 3 of us"
"Omg the burgers and chips here are Amazing. I had the patty cooked medium and ordered fries, however I wasn't impressed with the fries. My girl ordered a medium well burger and chips. I would advise not to get your burger cooked medium well it comes off a little dry. I'll have to give this place 5 stars for what I ordered and having amazing chips. Hats off to the chef!!"
Excellent food. Nothing like you would expect. We ordered the happy hour appetizers Chocolate filled beignets and the Bacon and Deviled eggs. Not only was I surprised about the presentation but the food was excellent and very flavorfully creative!!! I say give this place a try. You'll be just as surprised as I was. The only thing I would say is that the food takes quite a while to get to your table.
I have been wanting to visit this place for years. So happy I finally took to time to come.
"Very unwelcoming greeting! Came in with a school tour, decided to go to the cafe while I waited for the kids to finish up.  I was in the middle of texting with my wife so I picked a table on the patio.  I hadn't even set my belongings on the table I chose when I was immediately  approached by a lady who did not identify her self, but in a negative and unwelcoming tone asked me ""Can I help you"" !  Now I was a little thrown on why someone had approached me in this manner.  I replied I'm going to set my things down, sit here and then order something to eat, she replied ""well you have to Order up front"". Ok I said and she went away mumbling or muttering something.  When ordering I saw her in the far SE corner of the cafe with some other people, none including her were in any type of uniforms, she had dark hair and was wearing a brown/white and black dress or blouse so I guessed she was a manager or something.  

Now I have no problem with people approaching me and asking if I need help with something, I welcome assistance,  but the manner in which she approached me led me to believe that the way I looked or the way I was dressed made me stand out in her eyes.  Maybe the fact that I was Hispanic got her attention.  I don't know.  Either way we met.  

Sometimes it's not what you say but how you say it and given that she may have been the Manager at Devine Cafe, her approach might have been better receive had it sounded more like 

"" Good morning and welcome to Devine Cafe is there anything I can assist you with"". 

See and hear the difference.  

This lady for whatever reason made me feel like I wasn't welcome and she came over to let me know.

Seems like Discrimination and profiling are ever present even in a nice Place like Divine Cafe @ Springs Preserve in Las Vegas"
"Excellent food, higher price but well worth it! Service was good as well. The outdoor seating also makes for a great view for a little lunch date!"
"A four star just for the view alone...if you sit in the outdoor seating area that is. I've been lucky in that each time I've eaten here, I get a primo seat on a primo day and you can look out over the Preserve and far beyond. Really great view.

As for the food - it's good too. Used to be a Wolfgang Puck branded place, menu is a little different now, in fact they offer a good daily special board. It's run by the Culinary Institute now.

Had their BBQ pork sandwich, served with homemade crinkle cut chips (very tasty). The BBQ sauce was very smokey flavored, thick and a good balance of sweet and savory. Well done Culinary Institute! 
They offered a roasted butternut squash soup which was nicely prepared/presented (in fact all their food is) and tasted good.

It's a nice place to relax a bit in between or after checking out the Preserve."
"Came here for lunch during my residency interview. Has a great view the surrounding landscape. 

The food is great and the restaurant is bright, spacious, and open. A very pleasant dining experience overall, and great friendly service too!"
"We were pleasantly surprised with the food here.  I had the tasty chicken BLT and my husband had the Cuban sandwich, which was savory.  The Cuban burger was a bit dry but the overall taste made up for it. We also ordered the kids chicken fingers combo, which came with fruit, carrots/celery, tater tots and gold fish crackers.. One of the healthier kids combos we've seen in a while. Our kid loved it.  I had a glass of their Chardonnay, which was fruity and crisp. My husband had their Lager on draft.. Refreshing"
"Excellent food, good service, and it is true to say, what a ""divine"" experience! On the plate; pressed chicken Milanese with French fries; lightly breaded chicken, prosciutto, arugula, lemon pesto creme, pressed between naan. Serving size is perfect for an empty stomach! Pricing matches the size eleven dollars will make you holler! For my sweet tooth root beer float topped with a chocolate drizzled churro... Satisfaction granted and left with a smile on my face."
Super yummy and fresh. We happened to show up once on accident for a Easter buffet that was all you can eat and my lord -it was super yummy! We always try to plan our trip to the spring preserve so that the cafe is open.
"Amazing view, affordable prices, excellent food, good service. Perfect experience, I'll be going back every week for lunch."
My little LOVES the kids Mac and cheese. I've tasted it and it's yummy. Wish they had an adult bowl. I recently tried the teriyaki bowl. My new favorite meal.
"First time visitor this past Sunday.  I took my sister and mother here for their Mother's Day brunch.  Layout of the food was confusing.  Why would you put bacon with cold fruit and not with the hash browns and sausage?  Why would you not put a pan of scrambled eggs out?  Why would I have to stand in the omelet line for scrambled eggs?  Why does it take two ""chefs"" with 4-6 pans going at the same time over 7-10 minutes to make an omelet?  Why was I ignored after standing in line for an omelet?  Very disappointed, but willing to give this place another shot...but not anytime soon."
"I came here for a quiet place to eat lunch and work a year ago and now I come at least once a month. The CafÃ© is on the upper level overlooking Springs Preserve, and you can sit indoors or outdoor, great view.  The new food is yummy and affordable. I love the wedge salad w/ chicken, the hummus and the homemade potato chips.  They also have infused water with seasonal fruits, though they recently started charging $1.50 for it.

Great eats, great view and decent value"
"Hello Ursula.
Thank you very much for everything that you did for our family and guests.
Our sons catering for his Baptism was a very classy affair and everyone was impressed.
The food was gourmet and bountiful. 
We will see you real soon, and count on you for many upcoming events.
It was a pleasure to have met you and worked with you.
Thank you.
Charles, Jacqueline and Alex S."
"You can't go wrong at the springs preserve. There is acres and acres for you to explore! Today we went to eat at the divine cafe, which is a cute little spot that sits above the preserve so you can see over it, if it's nice outside definitely sit outside for the great view. 
They have the farmers market on Thursdays but there wasn't too many booths this time, there was organic honey, vegetables and a plant with no soil basically like a patio plant very unique. 
This place is all about the kids! They have a state museum, a play ground, a train so you can see all the acres, and tons more that get switched out so your always seeing something new. 
This place is perfect if you love nature and walking! You definitely can't see it all in one day, I am a donor member and I still see new stuff every time I go!!"
"Came into this place, we were told we could sit anywhere. Decided to take the outdoor seating and enjoy the great view and weather. Boy was that a mistake! 

We were almost completely ignored by the wait staff. We attempted multiple times to get their attention to attempt to get served. Every time we were told some body would be by, nobody showed up after. 

Many other people sat down after us and they were visited by the wait staff and got their drinks. We weren't even brought water. After an hour of being ignored we decided to leave."
"The Good:
excellent tasting food
healthy choices
reasonable prices
peaceful setting with great views, especially outside
great kids menu

The bad:
Try to avoid during kids field trip lunches for obvious reasons
they closed!  looking forward to the new opening...I hope they maintain the high quality and reasonable pricing.
the last few days they were open prior to shutting down was disgraceful...they really phoned it in."
"I love taking the kids and our visitors to the Springs regularly.  It's one of LV hidden treasures.  Having Divine Cafe makes it even better.  Don't have to make an extra stop or eat junk food prior to our day. A great family outing. We always lunch at the Divine Cafe before we start. The food is excellent and always fresh and hot.  The kids love how their food is served. I will leave this surprise for ur visit.  We made reservations for Mothers Day and was not disappointed. Omelets, pasta and sides were fresh and hot. I like my food very hot or crisp and cold!!! The steak was perfectly seasoned and tender. we tried several drinks that were consistently mixed the second time around!  The bacon was in a odd area but no crowd getting to it. The size of the desserts r perfect!  No waste for a perfect taste! The price is very affordable for the Brunch with a view to Make a perfect beginning or ending of ur day.  We look forward to another Brunch!"
"Okay, so first of all, my ahi salad was very, very good. Also, cucumber water is always a treat. And, the view is spectacular; one of the best in the city. Now that's out of the way...can we talk price vs portion? My salad was delicious, but for a $10+ salad, I'd appreciate a larger helping. I'm not even asking for more Ahi; there was plenty of that; buy dump on the greens, I can take it. Also, and this was purely circumstantial, though I can imagine it happening often: people's children. Christ on a cracker, can you please control your little zoo animals? Letting your children run, play, roll around on the floor, and use adjoining empty tables as their own jungle gyms is not only rude to other patrons, it demonstrates a significant deficiency in parental ability. To the restaurant: please discourage this kind of obnoxious behavior. I absolutely love the Preserve, but hesitate to bring my friends with me to Divine Cafe, lest we get caught up in some variant Lord of the Flies scenario. Otherwise, thanks for the fresh food and the relaxing, great view on a sunny day."
"We love this cafÃ©! It's our second time here in less than 2 weeks. The experience is perfect and the view over the preserve gorgeous!
You must try the chicken press parmigiana sandwich soo good!"
"For such name there is a need to do some changes in your kitchen guys.
We just ordered the burger and the quesadilla.
Went thru half of the burger and I had to stop. The quality of the food is really poor.
There is almost no taste in the food.
The quesadilla is not any better .....
Overall it's worst than bar food .... 

Recommend to hire a chief that cares about the food he serves and add some flavor in your food.... 

PS taste of old oil is not considered as a desirable flavor. 

Thanks"
"Most of us have gone to a theme park and been greatly disappointed by the food services.  Usually prepackaged, microwaved fare or fast food level, or super pricey)   Even the great San Diego Zoo has mediocre food for the most part (although if you search they do have some gems).  So I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at the Springs Cafe which offers well prepared, gourmet style lunches and entrees at affordable prices.  I had a ceviche salad that was excellent.  The hamburgers were great and the sides excellent.  The sundays foods were yummy.

This isn't a gourmet location though and the service is underwhelming, the ambiance mediocre. In fact the service was very poor, they tried to bring our deserts (we got free sundays with the coupon on the flyer) at the same time as the meal. Then when we got them to understand we wanted them to wait on delivery, they got mixed up as to how many we ordered.  Also the food takes a while.  But the food is worth it and even the picky eaters I was with enjoyed their meal without complaints, not an easy task."
Line was not too long to order. Prices are affordable. Kid menu items are perfect for the children. I had the Cuban sandwich and it was worth the wait. Delicious will come again to the springs preserve just for the cafe hahaha.
Nice friendly staff. Amazing view. And the food was great.  Clean place. Will for sure be back. Thank you all
"This cafe is under new management since October 2011. It employs interns who have graduated from the Culinary Academy for its cooks, and its servers. 
Note that the cafe can be entered without paying admission to the Preserve.

We split a vegan burger, which they thoughtfully cut in two and served on two plates with tomato, lettuce, 2 pickle spears, french fries,and a scoop each of quinoa salad. When we requested hot sauce our waiter brought two different kinds, then brought a grilled jalapeno pepper to boot! The manager stopped by to ask about our experience. We were among the earlier customers the day we went; lunch crowd was only starting to come in.

We chatted with our young, eager waiter. We found both the service and the food good! We will be back, when next we are in Las Vegas!"
"One of the best kept secrets in Las Vegas!!! My family of six stopped by this Sunday after our Walk with a Doc program. Everything was great!! I ordered an eggs Benedict with a prickly pear mimosa and wow!! Seriously, one of the best rendered eggs Benedicts  that I've ever had in Vegas. The eggs were perfectly poached and the Holladaise sauce was light...the other dishes were great, including by a burger on Brioche with butter lettuce. A great way to start a pre-birthday Sunday"
"The food here is yummy and well prepared, a relief with kids in tow.  Just not that many items on their menu.  I say this because I expect overpriced pre-packaged food from museum cafes.  However, it seems to be very well run with a manager who oversees the preparation of the food.  The menu is simple and the staff very friendly.  I love the view from this location of the preserves, as well as, the Strip, most specifically you can see the Stratosphere.  I forget I'm in Vegas!  For what you get, the food is good. Don't hesitate coming here if you're visiting the Spring Preserves.  Of course the prices will be inflated but they're not outrageous."
"Great view, great food, great prices and close to downtown where I live. Will come back and recommend it to friends."
"Great spot for lunch. 
Great view of the strip. 
You order your food, they give you and number, pick your seat and wait.  
Friendly staff. 
I had the turkey melt with avocado-very good.  
Outdoor seating is available."
"I have visited this establishment three times in the past month, so obviously the food must be good enough, which it definitely is. I personally enjoy their salads, which are fresh and tossed with just the right amount of dressing. Their pizza is 8 slices, and large enough for a small family to share. The place is clean and neat, and the ambiance is just incredible.
The staff is less than impressive. On each of my last three visits, I have particularly had bad experiences with the cashier. The first time she mistook my order and did not charge me for a third drink (I ordered a kids meal and three extra drinks, she mistook the drink that came with the kids meal as one of the extra three). When I grabbed my fourth drink from the fridge and turned to leave, she yelled ""Ma'am, you have to pay for that!"" As if my paying $60 for lunch suggested I was trying to lift a juice box. To top it off, she had me go to the back of the line to pay for the drink. I let it go. 
On my second visit, she mistook my order again. No big deal. We corrected it then and there. All was fine, but not the best, because I couldn't help but think ""Really, same person... Again?!""
Last weekend, I went for a third visit after a long afternoon of roaming the preserve. I placed my order, and believe it or not, the same woman mistook my order. I had to repeat it slowly and holding the most uncomfortable eye contact... ever. At this point in my review, I feel completely confident in stating this person undoubtedly recognized me, and had absolutely done this on purpose, because such stupidity is just not possible. Anyways, we had lunch. Washed our hands, made it down the elevator with a stroller, 5 children and friend, when my oldest realized he dropped some money at the table. We all rush back up to look for it. Alas, it was gone. I held the door as all of my tribe walked out of the restaurant, but my oldest B-Lined to the cashier. He asked her if she had found any money laying around, and she had the nerve to lean over the counter and say ""Honey, no one is giving you money here.""
To the establishment's management, unfortunately, I will no longer be giving my money to the rude, smart mouthed, but none the less beautiful, young woman at your cash register. 
Your food is great. The price is appropriate and the variety of food is healthy and tasty. But, the general customer service has left this mom feeling very disgruntled. Luckily, the Springs Preserve allows for food and drinks to be brought in."
"We just love this place every time! They have fresh food that fits everyone's taste buds. This is great place for kids, work lunch and groups. The view of the strip and downtown is amazing too!"
"I think the best part about this place is the great views you get while you eat. The lines just to order food are pretty long but once you get by that the food comes pretty quick. The food is good, basically what you would expect from any park restaurant. If you are in the park its quick and easy to stop by and get a bite to eat."
"Here's the thing about the food there.  While it is great, it is so overly expensive.  I would recommend eating in the outdoor setaing, if you can."
We had a great experience at the Mother's Day brunch. The staff was friendly and went the extra mile for us. Their attention to detail was apparent- they even had to-go style coffee cups. Food and atmosphere were great. We will be back.
I was expecting event type food at a really high price. But what I actually got was a big cheeseburger with good meat and seasoned fresh fries. I was blown away. Price was great for what I got.
"Had the vegan burger, the patty fell apart, and that happens sometimes with veggie patties, but it also lacked flavor.  The fat fries were good but not exceptional.The husband had the margarita pizza it was nice and thin but also lacked seasoning. Next time I'll try something else, I'm not willing to give up on this place yet."
"I came here for lunch with five other friends. I wanted to try the bento box because, I love bento boxes and I've heard some buzz about them. But after eating some of mine, and seeing what my friends were eating, I really regretted it.

Everything was greasy, even the rice. I scooped my rice to the side of the box to strain some of the grease. Yes, it was that bad. I couldn't finish it.

My friends had the salad bar, a cobb salad, vegan burger and flat bread sandwich (5th friend also had a bento box). The Springs Cafe is all about healthy eating and natural foods so I should have ordered something of that standard.

I want to go back because my dining companion's lunches looked SOOO good, but I definitely will NEVER order another bento box.

There are waiters, but the service is similar to a buffet restaurant where you pay for what you want first, get your beverage cup and seat yourself. There server who delivered our food and checked on us a couple of times was very nice and professional."
"Super overpriced, but a great view. Came here for my birthday for lunch prior to taking a walk around the preserve. A majority of the tables were reserved for those doing the buffet so we had to walk around looking for a table that was available. The buffet was super overpriced for what they offered. The pricing was just slightly less than eating at Bacchanal at Ceasars, yet not even offering a quarter of Bacchanal. Needless to say, we opted for the regular menu which was also pricey. My husband ordered a pizza and the dough was way under cooked and doughy. I ordered the chicken teriyaki plate which was not good. The chicken had a heavy soy sauce taste and lots of tough pieces. Only giving it a 2 star because of the view."
Had the chicken club wrap which was delicious. Service was top notch as usual - very good and anticipated my needs.
"We had a good lunch mostly. The regular food on the menu was great. I got the chilled noodles and my mom got the island po'boy. Both were very good. We got 2 kids meals for the kids and they both wanted mac n cheese. My daughter said the grapes were gross and the tater tots were cold. They need to add organic fruits and vegetables for the kids. And serve Annie's mac n cheese instead of the fake kraft stuff. My kids could tell it was poor quality food. 

The ambience is very nice and service was very good."
"This review is solely based on the Mothers Day Brunch . I feel for the price this was a OK experience. We went to the 1-4pm  brunch. Upon arrival there was a bit of line but overall it wasn't that long of a wait at all. When we were seated the family proceeded to head off and get food. They had a Chicken and Waffles station, Carving station, Salad bar and Omelet station that also had bacon and sausage.  The lines to get to each food line were pretty long and it made it difficult with the children but the Chicken was really good and the waffles were delicious.    The longest wait was for the Omelettes which were totally worth the wait but they RAN OUT OF MUSHROOMS . It totally was a buzz kill but the staff working that station were really friendly and did a good job making up for not having my favorite ingredient. I felt like we really didn't have a server at all so I was constantly flagging someone down to try to get our Mimosa or plates cleared off. Most of the desserts were really STALE and just didn't satisfy me at all even though they had a large variety to choose from. I would give this brunch a try again but definitely would choose to go to the morning session."
"Def a restaurant with a great view: Flatline view of the north end of the strip with the top view of the Stratosphere. It is an order your own food and then sit down kind place- so partial service restaurant. Surprisingly all the items that were recommended on Yelp from previous Yelpers were all not on the menu- tells me they possibly could change the menu quite often. BONUS: CHECK IN AND GET A FREE FOUNTAIN DRINK
Overall the food the was OK. I wish i could give it better stars- the thing that made this worth it was the view. 
Lastly one thing they need to learn how to control is the at least 5-8 pigeons that kept flying around the TV screens and above our heads. My friends kept screaming because the birds were flying so close to us. Also on Sundays please play the NFL games outside!!! Would be an extra bonus

May be back for the view and see the possibly changing menu."
"We stopped by after the annual fall plant sale as we were having a food crash. I was not expecting much...boy what an incredible treat this place is. 
I ordered the burger and my husband got the chilaquiles off the brunch menu. We enjoyed our meal so much we stopped by again on Monday since we were in the area. This time we split a burger and a wedge...the wedge was beyond delicious and HUGE ! They nailed it, hard boiled egg sprinkles all over, small cherry tomato halves and sliced cucumber with drizzles of dressing, some kind of amazing goodness. We split a small cup of tomato bisque, so delicious.
This is our new go-to spot ! We love Springs Preserve and adore Divine Cafe..."
"New name and menu and improved food.  Checked our the restaurant at the Springs Preserve for the first time since the latest update.  I've eaten at the cafe 5-7 times over the years including when it was Wolfgang Puck and after as well.  I think this update is an improvement in both price and taste. We had 3 entrees and 3 kids meals for $44. My kids are 3,5,6 and the kids meals were a good amount of food for them asks included fresh fruit / veggies. The kids mac n cheese is yummy and the snack tray was perfect for my 3year old. The lobster sandwich special was awesome with the tomato bisque soup especially for $10. The service was so good although I've never had an issue on previous visits they just seemed a little more friendly this time. In the past the foods quality was hit or miss and a little overpriced. As a member that meant we normally skipped the cafÃ©.  With this update we will definitely stop more often on our visits."
"The Divine Cafe at the Springs Preserve is serving up some great food and it doesn't seem that many people know about it. 

The patio has a great view of the Strip or you can sit inside where there are plenty of tables as well as high-tops. 
The menu offers salads, small bites, burgers, sandwiches, pizza (gluten-free crust available), a kids' menu, plus the excellent desserts.  
Service has been top-rate and there is just an overall relaxed vibe here with people enjoying the great atmosphere and their meals.
Discover Divine CafÃ© soon and see what you've been missing. "
"Great food, good service, amazing view at a just-right price. We'll go back again."
"Excellent food choices, service and flavor. The presentation is top notch at an affordable prices"
"LOVE the Springs Preserve and have always enjoyed the food, but today was BAAADDD! 

I took friends from out of town. Wanted them to have a locals, ""non-Vegas"" experience. They loved the place.  We all ordered the ""breakfast taco"" from the Sunday brunch menu. Turned out to be 3 little tacos which would've been fine, but they were COLD. The little corn tortillas were tough and chewy. There was almost no egg, but there was a long strip of bacon (cold) in each one, hanging out the ends. Terrible presentation. There was something that we decided was cheese melted onto the little tortilla. It had a slice of avocado and supposedly sour cream. The whole thing was very skimpy. I was embarrassed. My friends kept assuring me it was fine, but it was not. 

I have been to the SP many times and have always loved taking people there. I will think twice, though, about doing it again.

I would like someone from the Divine Cafe to reply to this and let us know what happened. Was the chef not working this day? Was this a new offering for you and you didn't really have it together? What? Please tell us this was a one-time goof-up and not what you will be serving  for other Sunday brunches."
"Excellent food in a great atmosphere. I had a bowl of the pork fajita soup and enjoyed the rich stock, black beans, tomatoes, chunks of pork, and tortilla strips. The ice tea is flavorful. They deliver the food to your table and check on you midway through eating. I will return whenever I can."
"Everything about this cafe is amazing. The food, the service and of course the view. You can bring your kids for a great lunch and some fun or even happy hour with friends for a glass of wine and a perfect shot of the strip. 

The catering that comes out of this place is fantastic as well, I have now had several events catered by them and have never had a bad dish. In fact, the majority of dishes that I've had, I've begged for the recipe. 

You absolutely cannot go wrong with Divine Cafe."
Tried their take on the Monte Cristo and it was EXCELLENT!!!  It was different to have a perfectly fried egg served on top.  The sandwich was perfectly paired with some tots.
"ABSOLETELY love the food here. Haven't ordered something we haven't liked. If I could give more stars I would. Service is absolutely excellent. Today I happened to leave my credit card without realizing. To my surprise, as I was leaving the parking lot our server was waiting for us. She flagged me down and returned my card to me. To me this is going above and beyond! I only wish I knew her name, but a big thank you for being so awesome! It isn't everyday someone would do that. Thank you to the whole staff for providing great good and service!"
came for the easter brunch - my kids loved the food and the accommodating staff.   will try their happy hour next!
"I cannot express how much I love this place, the food is so unique it will leave a mark on you to come back. They offer a little bit of everything for those who are picky eaters like myself so don't worry. Just try to get there before the lunch rush, because people will be packing in there to get some grub!"
good for fancy food. You don't get a ton of bang for your buck but you do get quality flavorful entrees. I had the feta and beet salad and it was yummy. However I left feeling hungry.
"This is a great spot for lunch. 
Prices are affordable. 
Food  is really good. 
Portions are generous.
They have a really good selection  of iced tea. 
I have been here several times, and will keep coming back.
Can bring the family or meet for a business lunch.
Lots of parking.
I have never had a bad experience here.
Vegetarian options.
Definitely  would recommend."
So this place is bomb dot com! Got the sunrise brunch sammy (dankies) Got the Monte Cristo sammy (double dankies) Got the great view from the patio deck (triple dankies) infused water was a bust at 1.50 a piece but still 5 star dankies overall
"The Springs Cafe has excellent food for a great price. My family and I go here all the time and love it. Also, it has a really nice patio area with great views of the Las Vegas strip."
"The vegan burger is my favorite thing on the menu and I'm a meat eater. It's surprisingly good. No wait, I lied. The Monte Cristo sandwich is the best thing that has ever been on the menu. Unfortunately it is no longer being sold.
Also, the Springs Cafe is astonishingly better than the Wolfgang Puck crapshack it has replaced. There's just no comparison.
If you're going to the Springs Preserve you'd might as well eat there. The food is pretty good and you can't beat the convenience."
"Can't say enough good things about this restaurant!  

We've attended a few of their  special events (Fathers Day, Mothers Day, etc), the Thursday night happy hour numerous times and quite a few regular lunches and we've NEVER been disappointed.  

The food is excellent and very affordable, the service has always been top notch and who could complaine about the fantastic view??

If you're looking for a great place for a brunch, lunch or happy hour, you couldn't do better than Divine Cafe at Springs Preserve!

Also an excellent place to bring out of town guests, such a beautiful place to stroll around after a great meal!"
"This place is really good excellent service and you can sit in the outdoor seating and enjoy the great view. Enjoyed the Crispy Fish Tacos with French Fries, it was fresh and very good. Definitely plan on returning and taking a nice walk around Springs Preserve."
A great place to enjoy a bite to eat while visiting the Springs Preserve or just looking for a new hangout. The food is super (burgers are huge!) and the staff is very friendly. Prices are surprisingly low.
"LOVE this place. Culinary institute is cooking up some tastiness at this joint for affordable prices! Pretty romantic view of the strip. Too bad they are not open evenings. Lovely, detailed dishes that the palette loves. Incredible salads. Can't wait to come back to try more items."
"If you like watery Margherita Pizza then this is your place to eat while here ... there was literally no customers in the cafe and only 11 other people besides us on the patio ... table was dirty, waitress delivered our pizza with no plates, napkins or silverware so, we had to ask for it. The guy who gave my husband his beer said nothing at all ... just set it down quickly and left ... wow! Having come from 20yrs+ in Customer service including managing a restaurant business, this place hardly deserves even 1 star. I think an over haul is in order because this place needs some serious help!"
Great fresh healthy food at great prices. The Fish Tacos rocked. Wonderful members benefit. Nice reprieve from the Desert environment outside.
"For ambiance, price, selection, and quality of food, this cafe does as well as anyone.  They even offer discounts to SP members.  We recently had a group brunch on a Saturday and this turned out to be a perfect venue.  It's not crowded at that time (surprisingly), so we were able to stay a long time without feeling we were taking up space from other customers.  

The brunch food was really good and really well priced.  Seriously, I think for brunch there are only one or two things on the menu that are over $10.  You can't say that about even the junky pancake houses.  Plus if the weather is good you can eat outside, away from traffic, and with a view of the preserve.  It's also mostly shaded outside.  

I often take out of town visitors here to eat.  My most recent lunch was a poke (Ahi tuna) salad which in which there was a very generous amount of tuna - and I think it was only $10!  I was very happy.

I will keep returning."
"Biggest surprise of our trip. Maybe it's because we had such low expectations going in (went for convenience) but this place was super good! All the food was good (Monte Cristo, Chicken Fajita soup, Turkey melt with avocado, side salad with balsamic, kids burger with tater tots, carrots and grapes). Nice presentation, good taste, everyone was happy! Which is hard to do. Free drinks all around for checking in on Yelp. Nice stop, especially if you're already at the Springs Preserve."
"I've been meaning to check out this cafe (and the Springs Preserve) for awhile, and am happy to say it's definitely a place I'll be keeping on my ""go to"" list.  As other reviewers have pointed out, you don't need to be a member of Springs Preserve to go to the Divine Cafe, although I would highly recommend making a pleasant day/afternoon of it and seeing the Preserve, along with the Nevada State Museum which is also there on the grounds.   It's extremely interesting, educational and also great if you have out of town relatives or friends who are bored with the same old same old hotels, bars, Strip stuff.  

Divine Cafe is wonderful to get away from  the noise, congestion and tourists - that's why so many locals have found it and enjoy going there for a bite.  It's located on the second floor near the Origen building.  You can take the elevator or stairs to get there.  It's a very open, clean and attractive space with indoor and outdoor patio seating.  If you sit on the patio/deck as I did, you can get a beautiful panoramic view of the surrounding area, the Preserves, and off in the distance, the Strip. On a lovely day with cooler weather, it's certainly one of the more pleasant destinations around!

You order your food from a nicely varied menu that serves up food every bit as good as any restaurant in town. As others have pointed out, this is not some cheapo snack bar with crappy burgers and hot dogs.  This is quality food.   When you place your order, they give you a cute little table holder with your order number.  You can sit anywhere you like, indoor or outside.    Yes, the prices are a bit on the high side, thus my four stars, however, it may be worth it to you for the location and quality.  I had the Angus burger ($9.50) and it was very good.  High quality beef, bacon strips, arugula leaves instead of the usual lettuce....I was very pleased! I ordered it ""well done"" and guess what?  It was cooked PERFECTLY!  None of that icky red beef that seems to be the ""in"" thing for burgers these days.  And the meat patty was still wonderfully juicy and had that top sirloin flavor that you'd expect from high quality beef. The bacon strips were also perfect - neither too thick nor too thin, crunchy yet not chewy as is often found on burgers today.  It  came with fries which were nicely seasoned, crisp, and flavorful.    

In addition to the burger, I had the hazelnut beignets which came with TWO yummy dipping sauces - raspberry and caramel.  Price:  $6.00.  Again, a bit pricey but there was enough for two, so it was definitely splittable.  Total:  a bit over $16.00.  But hey, this is sort of a unique place, in the Preserves, with a view, so I guess you'd have to say you're paying for the ambiance.  The food is very good and is really  better than other places I've been, both on and off the Strip.  Bottom line, I'd for sure go back and would be happy to bring out of town visitors here for an enjoyable day of browsing the Spring Preserves and then topping it off with a lovely lunch/brunch on the patio looking out at the view. You can also order beer and wine, although I didn't check that out.  I can see how it would be really nice to sit with a drink for awhile there.   Servers and staff were friendly helpful and very professional.    

Divine Cafe opens at 11am (weekdays), 10am on weekends (brunch),  and closes  at 3pm, so be sure to time your Preserves browsing to end  back at Divine Cafe around 1:00 or so, you don't want to feel rushed to eat and leave by 3pm.   Thanks Divine Cafe, for a very enjoyable meal!  Looking forward to doing brunch next time and having  the french toast! I'm sure it's fab!"
"I went to this place yesterday and was served a buffalo chicken and blue cheese salad. My husband got a bbq brisket sandwich on a pretzel bun with fries. Or food was good, but it wasn't too hot temperature wise. Additionally the brisket sandwich was sliced brisket, so it didn't really blend with the sauce well. Because of this, my husband didn't really easy much of it. We enjoyed the food though, the service was good and polite. We will definitely be back."
"Food is delicious, waiting for the food took a while but it was during the superhero day so it was pretty busy. I wanna come here during Sunday brunch!"
Fish tacos and breaded chicken breast panini on naan with fries. Delicious to the last bite! Fresh and high quality ingredients. Highly recommend trying this tucked away gem of a place. Did I mention the great view of Las Vegas to go with your respite? Great atmoshpere
"I almost hate to write to this review because sometimes you want to keep a great secret all to yourself. That's what I feel the Divine CafÃ© is - it's a place that not many people know about which is a shame because it's such a great place. It's a very open, casual place where the mix of customers seem to all be enjoying their meals. We go to the Divine CafÃ© every Saturday unless something comes up or I'm out of town and it seems like I always have the burger with cheddar cheese. These burgers are huge and come with either salad, fries, or their homemade chips. They are topped with lettuce, tomato, bacon, and a really great pepper mayonnaise.  I've had great burgers here in Vegas, but for me all those other burgers don't compare to the burger here. This is the place with the best burgers. I always take the family so I've ""tasted"" other items from their menu and have to say that I have enjoyed everything I've tasted there. 

The Divine CafÃ© is located at the Springs Preserve so after eating we walk the trails or see the exhibits they have to offer. As members we get ten percent off our meal. The staff is always friendly - from the person taking our order to the person who brings the food to the table. It's a great place. The cafÃ© has a great outdoor seating area that gives you a great view of the city. We love to sit outside and enjoy good company, good atmosphere, and good food.

When I have out of town guests come to visit you know that before they leave Vegas they are going to the Divine CafÃ©."
"Let's start surg the view and exceptional service. Now my favorite the FOOD is fresh, delicious I love this place"
"Had the lunch here during the Asian Heritage Celebration. The food is actually quite good, but we waited more than 30 mins for two orders of food because our order receipt wasn't printed out so they skipped ours. When we expressed our concern to the manager, she just didn't seem to care about our problem, and she actually did not know what's the big deal and just pushed us away. Very BAD dining experience and won't recommende to my friends at all."
"I was quite impressed with the cafe. I always assume food vendors and restaurants inside of museums or government buildings are more of a convenience than an actual attraction however the Divine Cafe has me waiting for next weekend to return. 

I love Veggie Benedict's so I gave theirs a try and to my surprise the ingredients were fresh and the presentation was impressive. The views of the valley are also worth trying the Cafe. 

I would have given them a 5 star review but the only reason I couldn't was because they cooked the spinach on the Veggie Benny instead of using fresh spinach leaves. This is more of a preference of mine vs an actual knock on the cafe. The rest of the menu was diverse and had many great, light summer type meals. 

I believe the menu was well thought out since most customers will be continuing their exploration of the park therefore need a light meal to avoid feeling sluggish. I enjoyde the cafe very much and can't wait to go back."
"Diverse menu, beautiful view, exceptionally fresh, quality food, friendly and knowledgable staff, spacious seating (indoors and outdoor), kid friendly, healthy choices, and convenient for those visiting the park (you can also drive up and enter the cafe separately). I had a burger and was pleased that they offered to cook it to medium. It came out perfectly and was a huge portion. (Something I can't say I've felt at similar places.) Homemade chips were great. Fruit water was refreshing and welcome after a warm day. My son got a kid burger and I was really impressed at the variety and amount of food he received as well - veggies, fruit, crackers, tots, and a mini burger with drink included. Members get 10% off."
"I love this slice of paradise in the middle of the desert. It serves great, fresh food, along with a few beer choices. We ordered the Monte Cristo, Portallo mushroom panini with a side of broccoli cheddar soup, and the BBQ chicken salad. The spin on the Monte Cristo resembled a breakfast French toast with ham. Very good. The panini has a nice helping of provolone for the cheese lovers! That, with the mushroom and grilled zucchini and bell peppers... nom, nom, so good! Also, has outside seating overlooking the springs and a strip view."
"This is the 3rd  version of the Springs Cafe that I know of, and its still about the same.  To be honest, the location and the view get the 4 stars, the food probably warrants about 3.5.

The dining choices are good, and I've never had bad food or bad service, but there is nothing terribly special about the offerings. A solid burger, good wraps, good pizzas, some interesting specials. Again, the food takes second place to the location.

I would definitely recommend coming here if you're in the area, the views of the valley are great. Sit out on the balcony on a warm day an just take it all it."
"To my surprise(and disappointment) the Springs Cafe at the Springs Preserve is no longer under Wolfgang Puck but instead now ran by the Culinary Academy of Las Vegas.
They did stay within the same food guidlines as the previous owner which is to continue to offer a sustainable dining selection.
We went during the Halloween festivities and there was a special Halloween menu which was overpriced and not really a good selection of items.
I thought it was odd that the boo burger didn't come with any veggies - no lettuce no tomato, nothing. Hello, isn't this place is supposed to promote healthy eating? No veggies? Why?
So basically I got a bun, a burger (which seemed like it came out of your grocers freezer) and a slice of cheese. It reminded me of food while eating in a school cafeteria. Not $9.00 worthy at all!!!
The kid's meals also had those darn frozen dino nuggets and pizza sticks that you can find at Walmart.
Is the food fresh here or what?
Too bad about the food as the view & setting in this restrauant is beautiful.
I know the employees are students but whomever is instructing them needs to step up his/her teaching quickly or there won't be anyone to serve."
Wow ... what a nice surprise...food was very gourmet... View was excellent....totally recommend... can't wait to be here for happy hour...A+
"This place has a wonderful Vista from anywhere you said of the entire park. It is a little pricey for what they provide food wise, but it is a great place to eat or have a glass of wine in the afternoon or in the evening when they turn on the Christmas lights. My wife and I purchased the year-long pass for the reserve because it offers A lot of options for things to do. She and I like to run in there is quite a bit of space to run over different types of terrain and enjoy the scenery. Check it out if you're in the vicinity, I promise you won't regret it"
"I've been to several of their cooking classes and had such a great time.  The staff is really friendly and professional, the food is always good, and meeting new people is always a plus.  

The food on a regular business day is great as well.  Every time I go to Springs Preserve I eat there.  I definitely recommend."
"A true gem of a cafe. I've visited DC only twice and both times have been incredible. The staff is warm and genuine. The food quality is exceptional for ""fast casual"" and adequately priced. The view of the Strip is perfect; far away! I would eat here every day if it was closer to my home."
"One of the best museum Cafes around! My family and I really enjoy having lunch here after our regular visit to the Springs Preserve grounds & museums. I think they offer a nice variety of great food at fair prices. So far, I really haven't had anything Ive disliked. Have tried the burger, wedge salad with chicken, Cuban sandwich, chicken sandwich & Hawaiian teriyaki bowl. All good, fresh food & good portions. I have brought a few friends here who hadn't eaten at the cafe before & they were all pleasantly surprised. When the weather gets nice outside (spring & fall), we really like sitting outside & having lunch while enjoying the amazing views. Highly recommend checking it out."
"The wife turned me on to this place when we were searching for something local to do over the weekend and I was greatly impressed! We ended up spending the entire day at Springs Preserve because it is such a large place and there are quite a few exhibits to see, trails to walk/ride, and plenty of places to practice photography.

Since we're locals, we only paid $20 to get in ($10/ea.) and, at the end of the day, they allowed us to turn that $20 into a $45, two-person annual pass!

I took over 500 pictures that day and only spent time in about 60% of Springs Preserve.

Check out my photos here: http://www.panoramio.com/user/8631485/tags/Springs%20Preserve. That will give you an idea of what you'll see and what you can do.

The Divine Cafe is a great place to take a break, relax, and eat some great food. They also serve wine to go along with your pizza or other food offerings.

We don't have kids, but there were quite a few playing around in the kids playground and we were able to see the butterfly exhibit which was awesome!"
"I was a little worried about heading here today after reading the other review on Yelp, but I was greatly surprised!

My business colleague suggested meeting at Springs Cafe for a business lunch. The space was beautiful, clean and had free wi-fi! The food was fresh, quality and healthy. I got the bento box special with pork belly and forbidden rice. The pork belly was perfectly cooked and tender, the rice full of flavor.  My colleague had the fish tacos, which looked tasty and our client had a panini, which she said was full of flavor.

The staff was very attentive and helpful and everything was very well priced. I will definitely be bringing clients back in the future!"
"We really enjoyed our lunch here. I'm between four and 5 stars. Its located in the springs preserve. On the second story with a lovely view of the strip. Tons of greenery around us. Their is an indoor and outdoor section (with heaters for the winter, and it's covered for summer shade).

During happy hour Thursday's 4-8pm it's 5 stars. Right now probably 4 stars because the coffee tasted pretty trashy, and expensive for lacking in flavor brew ($3).
  
The food is surprisingly good. We had the pizza Blanca ($9.5): it had truffle oil, arugula, white sauce and mushrooms. Nice crust, good flavor. They have several decent craft brews available. We had a Samuel adams ($5-6)"
"Lots of parking, but may be crowded on some days.  No need to pay the park entrance fee to eat at the cafe.  The atmosphere is good and inviting.  Wonderful view of the city and the park.  Inside and outdoor seating.  The food is pretty good.  Staff members are friendly.  The manager dropped by to check on things and say hello.  Prices are a little high, but not bad.  Daily specials are served in a bento box.  The menu is designed with sustainability in mind.  Busy lunch crowd.  My favorite part of this experience is the atmosphere."
"Having seen brochures for the Springs Preserve since long before we moved to Vegas, I thought it was an over-hyped ""pseudo-outdoor"" attraction. And while there is a bit of that (pseudo-rock formations), I am sorry that we waited 3 years into our residency to get here. It's a really educational and beautiful place. 
But the most pleasant surprise was the Divine Cafe. Located on the 2nd floor of the same building that houses the gift shop [and the ""nature exchange""...an awesome idea], the cafe has a small but tasty menu. The burgers are high quality, the shoestring fries are 'divine', the charcuterie plate (while not quite up to the standards of the Andiamo version that I adore) had an assortment of yummy bites at a very decent price. We can't wait to go back and try their brunch and pizza selections!
And like every place in Vegas, the cafe serves a nice selection of adult beverages...again, at a very reasonable price, esp. relative to Strip prices. Not only is it GOOD food at good prices; but oh, the VIEW of the Strip from the patio. "
Wonderful stunning views of las Vegas from the deck! Kinda like a central park. They have basic American stuff like salads pizza and burgers. Its not cheap. But they have free chips and salsa at the corner end which is a plus.
"The prices are a little high for the size of the food you get. For example I bought a turkey wrap  (cut into 3 small slices) for $8.50. & a small kids pizza that my kids shared for $5. + $3 for a refillable drink. I really expected bigger, but overall the taste quality wise was good. My wrap was delicious with a hint of spice and red peppers. + fries. We sat on the balcony & ate & it was a nice experience. I will be back. =)"
"I haven't been here in a couple years since it was Wolfgang Puck's restaurant and even though it was good, it was pricey for what I wanted. I noticed this time around, it changed names and it took some convincing from my hungry boyfriend to just eat here while on our Springs Preserve date than venture off campus. That being said:

We ordered the chicken pesto pizza $10 and a burger (boyfriend never mentioned the name) $9-10 ordered medium rare. The views are beautiful and so relaxing with their floor to ceiling windows overlooking Springs Preserve and the Vegas skyline from the northwestern perspective. Food didn't take long and they brought it to the table. My pizza was definitely not just a personal size. It's good enough for two super hungry people or three people snacking. DELICIOUS. The oils from the cheese were everywhere and when you pull the slice, it had that glorious stretch of soft fresh cheese...the way pizza was meant to be. Johnny's burger was pretty good, better than I would expect. It looked like a gourmet burger with a half pound or so patty cooked medium rare with its juices still intact on a brioche bun. All the condiments you need are already on the table including hot sauces. Oh, and the fountain drinks include a dispenser of water infused with mint and sliced strawberries. With  a squeeze of lemon, it was amazingly refreshing and tasteful for the hot summer day.

I was pleasantly surprised. Definitely had the midrange cafe prices but service, food, and quality was there. Good stuff."
"Excellent.  My husband and I shared a wood fired pizza special.  It was the BBQ chicken and normally I don't like BBQ Pizzas as they are normally drowned in BBQ sauce.  This was delicate, cooked perfectly and had amazing smokey flavor.  It honestly was just perfect.  The view from the deck overlooking LasVegas was the final touch.  I will be back in a few weeks for work and will becoming by here for a nice lunch.  

I'm also an ice tea snob and it was also very well done.  Fresh and good quality tea, strength good and flavor able but not over done."
I have been to the cafe and the waiters were rude and the table where dirty food over priced and not that good. But I also have been out to a cpl of event in the last 4 months and they were the caterer for the events. At each event the food was horrible cold. My friend had hair in her food. The staff were rude. The tables the food was on was dusty. I am quite shocked these ppl get hired for events. Its awful. I would never use them for my event. I am sured to have pissed guest. Noone liked the food at the events. Atleats there was a bar thank god. BUT A BIG THIMBS DOWN for food and service. If you are having an event DONOT hire these ppl. What they think is upscale is not. Uggghhhh
"A very nice cafe on the grounds of the Spring Preserve. The Hawaiian pizza was really good, but I think it's bigger than they advertise. Not really a problem, but keep that in mind that two people could easily share a small personal pizza.

Great view of Vegas from the restaurant and the balcony."
"Such a fun, family friendly location. The kid's meals are always a hit with the itty bitty ones and the grown up options are always great."
"After a couple of hours touring the Springs Preserve I was feeling a bit hungry and thirsty.  I was also kind of hot as late May in Las Vegas is starting to warm up.  To complete my experience I thought I would give Divine Cafe a try.  It did not disappoint.

I ordered a burger because I was hungry.  I ordered an iced tea because I was thirsty.  I ordered a salad because I was hot.  It did not take long for my burger to come out.  And it came out perfect.  I asked for medium and that is exactly what I got.  It was still pink in the center and taste like quality fresh beef.  I had juice dripping down to my elbow so you know it wasn't dry.  The toppings were good too.  A nice thick slice of tomato, greens, super crisp bacon.  It was a fantastic burger.  The salad was pretty good too.  I like the greens they used.  And the cucumber slices were a nice touch.  I would have been upset about not having my choice of dressing but it was exactly what I would have ordered anyway.  A delicious vinaigrette.  The one complaint I had about the salad was the 8 inch long stripps of carrot that looked like orange noodles.  They were kind of hard to eat as they were too thin to be picked up by fork the way everything else was.  Other than that, no complaints.

I was fortunate that the staff at the order window saw I had left my bag from the gift shop at the counter.  I had a couple of things in there I did not want to leave without.  Like my ball cap and sunglasses.  I was worried when I could not find my bag but then I noticed they had pushed it aside and were waiting for me to collect.  Goodonya, Divine Cafe."
"Great lunch spot with a diverse selection, can't beat the views and the environment of the springs preserve itself. I want to come back and try their happy hour or brunch, too, when I have more time! The only downside is each time I've been in there's only been a few people in line to order at the counter, usually only one person taking the orders, and it's been very slow. The last time it took over 20 mins to get through the three of us in line, and that's half the time I have for my lunch. Other than that, the experience and food were great!"
"A snacking jewel in the Preserve.

Decent food and a surprisingly gorgeous view of the Strip is the main draw of the Divine Springs Cafe. I came here on Thursday for the Happy Hour special which is from 4pm to 8pm and offers bar food and a decent selection of beers. 

I went with the tater tots, that were free with a donated toy to ""Toys for Tots"", and the Chicken Nachos. I also sampled the house chips that we're placed on the table as soon as  sat down. This place is by no means a hot bed of foodie activity, but a more a refueling station after exploing the preserve.  

The food is on par with most bar bites, nothing was terrible, but it also wasn't mindblowing, it was just good. The Nachos are a huge portion and definitely shareable and the house chips were nice salty snack before we were inundated with salty carby treats. 

They only offer Happy Hour on Thursdays and the menu is pretty limited, but it's perfect food for socializing and catching up with the homies. I would recommend coming here during the day, this way you'll have a chance to snack on their full menu. 

Learn stuff and eat. It's the American way!"
Food was excellent and well presented. I had a wrap which was very good. My husband had the burger. It was huge. My son had the Monte Cristo breakfast sandwich. It looked very good.  The prices were also reasonable.
We went on third Thursday which touts a great happy hour.   The drinks were watery and they were out of almost everything we wanted.  The fondue was strange and the pretzel was giant but giantly lacking in flavor even when dipped in their gas station quality cheese. The service was slow and the atmosphere lacking.  One big disappointment.
"Another quality Happy Hour location in Vegas that I somehow came across. Only on Thursdays, from 4:00-8:00, they offer some great drink specials including $4 beers and $6 wines. The food isn't anything more than pub fare but it gets the job done. Live music and great views make for a nice evening. And the crowd was pretty small so you had the pick of the tables for sure. Definitely worth a trip on HH Thursdays. A nice change from your typical pub early evening out and a great way to begin Thirsty Thursday."
"A delicious and well rounded menu (with vegetarian options). Also, every Thursday from 4-8 is a Happy Hour with new menu items each week. Something for everyone on the menu."
"Had the brisket and also the vegan sandwiches. One with side salad and the other with fries. Both entrÃ©es were really good and the side salad with house dressing was surprisingly good. Also ordered the kids mac and cheese and appreciated how they had fruit and vegetables as sides. I'd get the vegan burger again. 

We received a membership discount so we were pleasantly surprised by our bill! I didn't give 5 stars because I would like to try another item on menu the next time we are here."
"The view is the cafÃ©s only saving grace. The service was beyond apalling. We ordered a turkey melt and a chop salad both with avocado in their description. The cashier mentioned they were out of avocado for the melt. The salad still came with the avocado. I inquired, out of curiosity, why the one came with it and the other didn't. One of the servers mentioned that they were instructed to only provide avocado to those who order salads. I then asked if I could speak with a manager and was told there is no manager on Sundays. I asked for a supervisor. The server said hold on let me grab someone for you. We waited 20 minutes. Nobody ever showed. Add to the remarks that the coffee was cold. I went in wanting to like the place. Truly a shame."
"Went there for the Thursday happy hour. Had a  glass of the cabernet on happy hour. Tasted great...so I had two. 

The bacon and date flatbread was excellent and I'm not a big fan of dates. I would come back and order that though. I would give that five stars.  

I was not impressed with the sliders on the happy hour menu. Actually very very disappointing. The whoopie sauce was basically ketchup and the buns tasted dry like they had been sitting out for days. The meat was way overcooked and lacked any flavor. 

I had a bite of the lotsa mozza salad. It was good. It didn't look like a traditional salad. It was on a polenta cake that tasted like cornbread and had marinara and arugula on top. It was quite good. I would recommend trying it. 

Also had the chicken Verde nachos. They were huge! Not very impressed with the taste though but nothing really that bad about them either. 

Just whatever you do don't get the sliders or else you may never come back. Glad the other people I came with ordered better than I did and let me sample a little bit of everything on the happy hour menu. Had a nice time and the view on the patio was spectacular."
"I think we like coming here better than the park!  Awesome food and reasonable prices.  Great view of the strip too.  Burgers, pizza, salads - they are all wonderful.  Everything is fresh and made to order.  After a hot day at the park, the soda fountain is to die for.

You dont even need to get into the park to eat there!  ;)"
Nice dining area al fresco.  Birds singing and great overview of park and city. Children's meal was perfect portion sized.  Vegan wrap and fries were tasty and delicious.  Friendly and accommodating staff.
"I have always enjoyed Divine Cafe until my most recent experiences. Our family has a membership at the Springs Preserve, so we eat there often. There was a recent menu change, and some of the dishes are now expensive relative to what you get. During my last visit there on a quiet weekday, it took the staff forty minutes and five tries to get my overpriced and mediocre quality meal correct. The employees were apologetic on behalf of the kitchen, and I was given a voucher for a future free lunch. While I appreciate the staff's efforts to make things right, I'm not sure we'll return to the cafe even with a Springs Preserve membership and a free lunch voucher."
"Great menu, delicious food and an amazing view of the city. Definitely an unexpected treat at a museum and botanical garden. Great kids menu too."
"Divine Cafe is connected to the Spring Preserves, but there is no need to be a member to dine here. If you are a member you get 10% off of your meal and membership is worth it IMHO. After having a delightful lunch you can explore all the Spring Preserves has to offer!

I almost always eat outside, where you have a fantastic view of the Strip. This last visit I shared the Cuban Sandwich with sweet potato tots  and  Pizza Blanca with my boyfriend. The pizza was terrific!  And my new favorite sides are the sweet potato tots. 

The outdoor seating area does have heaters when it is chilly. Happy hour is on Thursdays 4pm to 8pm. They sometimes have classes on how to cook too."
Way better than the academy cafe. The Gluten free vegan wrap is great! The place looks cleaner and the staff is friendlier.
"We go to the preserves often we think it is a great under utilized resource for knowledge for our community.

Fabulous pace to take the kids and visitors in showing Vegas.  This is our first time eating at the Cafe.  We are happy we went, they have lots of fresh items.  Salads, veggies and whatnot, the salad my man ordered was amazing he loved it, fresh crispy iceberg wedge.  I got the Caesar, yummy.  We also got the CHARCUTERIE a nice basic variety of tasty Cheese and Meats but good.  We finished off with a TURKEY WRAP it was so good, I was so full but ate more then I wanted.  

We of coarse had leftovers and enjoyed them after but for a large lunch we left very happy and will be back!  Yummy :)"
"Divine CafÃ© is one of Vegas's best kept secrets for casual dining.  Gorgeous view of beautiful Springs Preserve!  Where else in Vegas do you have a view of this many trees and beautiful greenery?  Awesome outside dining area!  I would recommend sitting out there if the weather is cooperating.  Springs Preserve is where Vegas started! History of this place is very cool!... But you can learn more about that when you go there :).  

Food is fresh and tasty, nice selection, kids menu and such great service!!  Everyone there was so incredibly friendly! The owner of the restaurant even came out and talk to us to make sure we were satisfied with everything.  I didn't catch her name, but it was so obvious that she and her team take such pride in what they do and in their food... awesome!  

Personally, I don't follow football, but I know they Broadcast games and have specials during the games.  
I think they host wedding receptions and parties as well - pretty enough for it!  If you haven't been there yet, you should definitely check it out!!   Perfect place for business lunches!

Check hours ahead of time because I think it's primarily a breakfast and lunch place."
I have been coming here at lunch this past year.  What makes this place is the food.  The view makes the experience great taking you away during a busy work week with the fantastic view.  My go to here is the Thai  satay salad and the fish tacos are always good.
Came here the other day with my two kids. My son ordered a quesadilla as usual and actually ate the whole thing- which he never does! It looked really good and came with a fruit skewer. I had the Mexican bento box. The meat was delicious but everything else was eh. I liked it enough to come back. Great food for kids I think.
"The portions were small and the fries were cold. Really expensive,  got a refund and ate across the street at the mall.  The employees were extremely nice and helpful"
This is probably one of my favorite spots to come and have lunch. It's healthy and really good food. A group of friends come here once a month to sit down and get together and have something to eat. It's really very lovely.
"The food was good but the service and professionalism was over the top. I and my 5 year old son and 11 year old daughter stopped by here for lunch after a fun experience at the museum and preserve. I ordered the tuna tataki, my son got the kids pizza, and my daughter got the kids mac and cheese.  

We were served after about 6 or so minutes but they did not bring out the kids pizza. Apparently what had happened was the cashier did not ring it up. I was prepared to go pay for it but they refused and comped it. Not only that they brought my son a plate of chips to snack on as he had to wait 5 minutes for his food while we had ours already. I thought that was pretty classy. AND THEN...they came out and gave us a complimentary desert of warm chocolate chip cookies with chocolate syrup. 

I was very impressed. My tuna tataki salad was very good...great views...and stellar service."
"Woah, this is some tasty stuff and huge portions for the adults! It is pricey but that is to be expected.  Wish the sides for the kids were a little bigger but other than that, I wouldn't change anything. This place was very clean, and ran like a well oiled machine. I wish you could just come here to dine without admission!"
"Great customer service, beautiful and peaceful view, but most importantly delicious food. I had the chilaquiles for bunch and they were so tasty, I'll let the picture do the talking for now. They have lots of fresh and healthy options as well. I will definitely return!"
"Let me just start this off with saying DIDNT EXPECT to spend the whole day here and indulge in happy hour, invite a friend out and listen to some tunes whilst enjoying the amazing view of the sun setting. I just wanted to check out the SP as I have not been before. My experience was five stars all the way, we will be making Thursday's a regular thing at Devine. Amazing service, can't beat the HH prices, food was delicious and the view is like the icing on the cake. Do yourself a favor and come here for brunch, lunch happy hour or good old fashioned dinner whatever fits into your schedule the vibe will sell itself. 


P.S. Thursday's Happy Hour 4-8pm usually with live music just saying (:"
Very beautiful atmosphere with fantastic views!! went for the weekend brunch which was really tasty. I had one of the breakfast sandwiches that had a nice jam spread and a prickly pear mimosa. I can't wait to return for sure to try more things off of their menu.
"Every year I have a tradition of hiking the trails of the Springs Preserve when ghosts, goblins, wicked pumpkins, and other haunted creatures adorn the park. I never got to experience the nightime Haunted Harvest. Knowing that I was going to be in the park all day, I decided to have lunch in the park's Divine Cafe. 

   My expectations of theme park /cultural center food is convenience over quality. However, Divine Cafe exceeded my expectations. It wasn't really a shock because I had been there before to enjoy a beverage. The restaurant did have a positive vibe. Heidi Knapp Rinella in her September 25, 2014 Review Journal article ""Springs Preserve's Divine Cafe True to its Name"" says it best:

       ""The Springs Preserve doesn't have to have
        a cafe. But, like the preserve, it sure makes
        life a lot nicer.""

  As soon as you exit the elevator or climb the steps above the gift shop, you enter a divine space. Your eyes immediately overlook the counter and football field of tables, chairs, and even sofas toward the glass walls with one of the most divine views in Las Vegas. This is a divine vista including a panorama of the Downtown Las Vegas skyline with the Stratosphere and Las Vegas Strip skyline framing the open spaces of dessert and wetlands. When it comes to eating with a view, Divine Cafe is a jackpot. The two places to enjoy the view are from inside and the patio. The inside is like a glass house where many tables are front row.

  Ordering is relatively easy. There are menus outside and at the entrance. I ordered the burger with fries and a fountain beverage. After a Yelp check-in offer for a free beverage with an entree it came to less than $11. The burger was made of the finest ingredients. This was a thick burger with tomatoes, bacon, mayo, and provolone cheese. The fries were plentiful and flavorful. The bottomless cola was refreshing. The condiments on the table made dining a better experience. 

  I was impressed with the service. Immediately the friendly lady greeted me when I walked inside. When I asked if the burger included cheese, she mentioned the four choices the menu omitted. She happily accepted my Yelp check in offer. Minutes after I put my number on the table, a friendly man brought my food to the table. He also cleaned up the plate. Another aspect of good customer service is confidence that no funny stuff is going on with my food. Divine Cafe has an open kitchen where I could see my food being made. Likewise, I know that it is being freshly made. On another note, Divine Cafe is especially clean. To my olfactory scent, the bathroom smelled more like the scented air in the Aria than a public restroom.

   Just like Springs Preserves, Divine Cafe provides a terrific experience at a great price. I was very impressed. Hopefully one day I could make their Thursday Happy Hour and take in the sun going down over the panoramic vista of Downtown and the Las Vegas Strip. Or maybe I'll return for their new weekend brunch. Until then, I will reward Divine Cafe with a review of four stars that says ""I'm impressed! """
"Great cafe with decent food, low prices, great environment, short lines, and plenty of seats.  This is a popular cafe for business luncheons especially with free wifi.

The burger ($9.50) is a solid meal with a side (options: tater tots, fries, soup, or salad)."
"We've been visiting the park for almost a year but it is our 1st time here. I'm between 4 and 5 star rating and heres my review:

Food - we ordered Chicken Milanese, Teriyaki Salmon bowl & rootbeer float with oreo churros - generous portions and were all yummy. They have fruit infused water for all which was great. We're looking forward to trying other items on the menu. Its good to have options beyond the usual burger and hotdog when you are at a park/museum.

Price - reasonable though everything is $10+. Reasonable becoz portions are generous and bcoz prices at themeparks and the like are usually pricier. 

Ambiance - dine inside or outside. The patio has good view of the mountains and of the Las Vegas hotel bldgs. The patio provides enough shade. We dined in September so it was comfortable outside I just dont know how it is in the middle of hot hot Vegas summer =) The whole place is generally clean and well kept.

Service - there seems to be adequate staff... but the food was served longer than expected. But we didn't really mind as we were enjoying the birds while we sat at the patio. All staff from the cashier to the server and table guy we're all very friendly.


We will definitely be back to try out other items from their menu and dine at their patio =)"
"Love this place. One of our secret ""locals"" spots. It's a cafe set up so nothing fancy but clean and comfy. The food is actually pretty damn good. Better than average lunch places. Prices are about what you'd pay for a meal deal at some nasty fast food place $8 to $9. Big portions and pretty presentation. Fountian drinks and some infused waters and different flavored teas available for refreshments.
It's a little hot during the summer but view is awesome. You can see the whole valley from the balcony. Highly recommend for businesses lunches or a quick meal out. Wish they were open longer but think they close at 3pm. Would be cool if they served dinner."
"I had the spinach salad with the beef, for $12 they need to throw on more spinach and less red onions, overall the salad was good.  My husband enjoyed his fish tacos and my kids could have split a kids meal, the pbj and grilled cheese sandwiches were huge and the fruit bowl that comes with the kids meal is huge too .. all for $4 per kids meal (sandwich, fruit and milk)."
This is one of the best places in Las Vegas that probably not too many people know about. I've been a member of the Spring Preserve for over 4 years and have had many experiences here from the museums to the numerous events held here. My family is here whenever we get a chance. The cafÃ© has good food and happy hour on Thursday (this is a good excuse to spend an evening at the Preserve minus the kids). You also get a panoramic view of downtown and the strip from the cafÃ©'s balcony
"I have been a Springs Preserve member since 2011. Dining at the CafÃ© has been part of our experience for a beverage, meal, brunch event, shaded place to sit and a great view. 

The Divine CafÃ© offers vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free (GF) (including a 9"" pizza for an additional fee) foods. Odwalla non-GMO shakes are available. 

I appreciate my 10% discount as a member. We always enjoy the music. 

Wish List:
Please offer ORGANIC options like milk, juice and food menu items (e.g. pasta, rice, produce, bread and tortilla, soup, and chicken tenders)."
"Prices are on the high side, for the quality of food.  I had what essentially was spaghetti with meatballs, and it was not that good.  The meatballs were super dense.  The sauce was too salty and greasy.  I think the pasta was whole wheat spaghetti, which i didn't mind, but I could see some people not liking the texture as compared to regular spaghetti.  My husband had a roast beef sandwich with french fries, which seemed ok.  The server brought the food without bringing any utensils, then went off for several minutes and served another table while we were sitting around waiting with food in front of us.  Kind of awkward.  A plus is the open feel of the place, plenty of seating, especially the outdoors balcony seating has a great view."
"What do I love about this restaurant!? I adore being able to sit outside on the terrace and eat my lunch. I love the variety of food they offer and the specials. It is near my work so every now and then I come over and dine here. I really enjoy their fresh, creative salads, the flatbreads are tasty and just last week I tried the special being tacos since it was Taco Tuesday. The service is good and looking out over the Springs Preserve into the city is absolutely beautiful not to mention relaxing. I love that they have a happy hour on Thursdays where one can come have a drink and listen to some music before heading home. As we all know driving up the 95 kinda stinks at the old 5:00 hour. They also offer creative cooking classes which I have yet to try as I am not Giada but maybe I will get around to it someday. This is a great kick back spot and we need to support this place. Do yourself a favor and give it a try!"
"Thankfully the food made up for the experience. An HOUR wait for our food, then I got the wrong burger!  They refunded me and our food was delicious, but again, having to wait with 2 young kids for lunch (past nap time) is like being in hell for a week!"
"Revised review... 
So sad to write this, as this has been our place for so long. I'm not sure what's going on at the restaurant there but things have definitely changed. The past few times we've been there it's taking an extremely long time to get our food. And we're not talking peak times we're talking just on a regular day where there aren't that many people and there's a 20-plus minute wait just to get a couple of entrees. This last time we went kind of did it for me. I got the fish tacos after waiting a really long time again, we ate... it wasn't til the last taco that I realized there was a thick black piece of hair in there. I brought it to the servers attention... they all stood there talked about it looked at it didn't say a word to me so we just left. As much as I love this place I don't really want to go back after that. They don't seem to care and that was just damn nasty. We eat out a lot and this was one of our regular spots. I'm kind of bummed.

Old review...

"Visit:  Weekend Brunch, Saturday, Nov. 14, 2015

My friend and I arrived at 10:00am -- I believe we were the first ones to arrive. The staff, including those that I could see working in the open kitchen all appeared to be happy and in wonderful moods. 

We ordered The Burger (cooked medium) with French Fries and The Portabella Burger (vegetarian) with a Salad.  And because the morning was nothing short of perfection, we sat outside on the veranda -- the outdoor seating area is large, overlooks the preserve, and has a fabulous view of the city.

The Burger is fantastic. The bread is soft, toasted, and buttery. The bacon is thick and crispy. The meat is of quality and was cooked perfectly. 

Feedback: Serving the fries in a bucket is cute, but it causes them to be less crispy. Next time, I'd ask to have them served directly on the plate.

The Portabella Burger is fantastic as well. In place of a beef patty, the ""burger"" patty is actually a large portabella mushroom.  With the addition of marinated roasted peppers and hummus, this dish has a Mediterranean vibe about it. 

Feedback:  I would have liked a bit more hummus and the salad to have been a tad more substantial, it was a bit skimpy.

I will return, again and again! 

---- 

My Order....

BURGER $9.50, + Cheddar
angus patty w/bacon, lettuce, tomato, cracked pepper mayo, brioche bun.

PORTABELLA BURGER (vegetarian) $9.00, + $1.00 for salad
grilled zucchini. roasted peppers. tomato. hummus. provolone cheese. brioche bun.

INFUSED WATER  $1.50

COFFEE  $3.00"
"The vibe and view here is great. It is overlooking the strip from a vantage over the preserve. The food is quite simple and clean - particularly great for kids' palates. They can get random big rushes of tables, so I wouldn't recommend it if you are in a rush. 
P.S. they serve wine"
Perfect spot for a casual lunch gathering along with a visit to the Preserve.  Second floor location provides nice views over park. Tasty salads and sandwiches (lobster roll - scrumptious). Proceeds from wine sales via 1Hope Wine go to humanitarian causes - great reason to order a glass of wine!
"I've been up here about 5 times now and the latest was when Springs Preserve held their Space exhibit.  What's not to love about this place.  The food quality has always been good, you can sit outside for a good view of Springs Preserve with your meal and their menu is simple.  

Don't come here if you're looking for a fancy place with a good view.  The menu literally consists of only salads, burgers, sandwiches, and pizzas.  Oh they do serve alcohol though!  

The last thing I got here were the lobster rolls which was yummy."
"I was pretty disappointed with the Mother's Day brunch. I was excited to try this place, especially for the occasion, as I had heard such wonderful things. Unfortunately, today it was quite disorganized and the staff didn't seem entirely sure of what was happening. 

We were offered beverages but told that any alcohol would be an extra charge. It was at the end of the meal when we inquired with another server about the inclusion of a mimosa that we received one. 

The food was cold, which probably had to do with all of the doors being open and the breeze blowing in. It didn't seem as though the items were made in house and it took some time for items to be replenished. The setup and placement were somewhat strange, too (ie the bacon was placed by the bagels and salmon on a wood tray - so definitely not warm). 

When my family got up to use the restroom, the server cleared their plates and beverages. We were not offered any refills either. Our server was very sweet, but seemed confused and overwhelmed. We saw her twice during our experience - each time she ran by our table it looked like she was holding too many dishes and needed to put them down. I guess I expected a bit more with the $30 price tag. We stayed maybe an hour and probably won't return."
"Yelpers, you should bookmark this place.  The Divine Cafe only has one happy hour and it's on Thursdays from 4-8PM.  The restaurant is separate from the Preserve so you don't need a museum or parking ticket.  

The cafe/venue itself deserves 5 stars all on its own because it is very large and can accommodate large parties, families, or intimate dates inside OR outside.  Outdoor seating would be my preference because it provides a panoramic view of Las Vegas.  You can see downtown as well as the Strip.  However, the indoors gives off a rustic vibe with doors and windows that still have access to that beautiful view.  There's also live music inside which, in my opinion, is uncommon in this city.  For all those reasons, this place is worth a visit.

Their happy hour menu is very limited, but has just enough variety.  They have their own cocktail drinks, a nice selection of bottled beers, and wine.  I was most impressed by the food portions.  We ordered nachos, calamari, and the date flatbread.  I thought they would be tapas style, and boy was I wrong.  The portions were very generous, and for the price, they're almost a steal considering the atmosphere of the restaurant.  Food was great, but my favorite was the bacon and date flatbread.

Give this place a go... I doubt it will disappoint."
"First time here with the family, per suggestion of my father in law. Love the set up, open seating, order at the counter & have the food delivered to the table. Simple and basic selections, easy to read menu.

I ordered the fish taco meal which came w/ 3 fish tacos folded in corn tortillas, topped with cabbage, a creamy sauce & cotija cheese. Very filling, but I think my mistake was I didn't get a side with it? They also provide drip coffee, hot tea, iced teas, & fusion water with the usual Coke soda fountain. Can't wait to eat her when it gets a little warmer w/ baby!"
"Great view, great food, great experience! 

I had the taco salad and I loved it! I didn't order anything to drink but they had flavored water (free) so I opted for that, that day it was strawberries :)

We sat outside and it was when it was still hot out but I actually still enjoyed it. The view makes you feel like you're not in the middle of the desert. You see parts of downtown Vegas and also have a view of the gardens below, so green :)

I'll definitely be back!"
"My friend and I were recently at the Springs Preserve for the Vegas Gone Yoga festival and we decided to check out this cafe while on a lunch break. I liked that they had a variety of different vegetarian friendly options and the outdoor seating area was beautiful. When you walk in you place your order at the counter and they bring it out once it's ready.

For food I decided to go with the garden sliders and a side salad. The sliders were not really a veggie patty, but more of a veggie mush. I wish they would have been more patty like, but overall the flavor was still good. (3.5/5) The salad was also a nice touch, very fresh.

This is definitely a nice option for a lunch break at the park with some beautiful scenery."
"Talk about a hidden gem! My friend and I came here for happy hour recently. What a beautiful view! The food and drinks were excellent (charcuterie plate, cocktails, and wine), and service was fast and friendly. It's a little pricey, and they're only open for happy hour on Thursdays (for now), but hopefully both of those will change.

Sit on the patio (or inside to listen to some smooth jazz), and soak up some nature while you're soaking up some drinks. You won't be disappointed!!"
We are members of the springs preserve and eat at this cafe all the time. Monday we went to the cafe  with our homeschool group. It was 4 moms and our kids. All of us  ordered food for us and our kids. 3 of the 11 kids we had with us have special dietary needs. Some are vegetarians and other have gluten and nut issues. When we came in and sat Down a man approached us and welcomed us. I informed him that we would all be ordering food but asked would it be ok if the 3 kids with food issues ate what their mothers brought for them. He said that was not a problem. So we all proceeded to order food for the rest of us. Which was 12 of us not including the 3 eating Their own food. As we were finishing ordering this very rude women started pointing at us and talking to the other workers. I said excuse me is there a problem? She said yes there was that those kids can't eat their lunch in here. I explained that they had food issues and the rest of us had purchased food. She rolled her eyes and said food allergies really? I was so embarrassed and uncomfortable. She said that the owner would never let that happen and that if she came in she would ask is all to leave. I have never felt so unwanted at a restaurant in my life. The owner would ask a group of moms and their kids to leave a restaurant because 3 kids have food issues that they can't help? I find that extremely hard to believe! We go to other restaurants that don't have an issues with this. This is the first place to ever give us a hard time. After we all got our food and were starting to eat she was still pointing at us while were eating and talking to another worker. It was so awful. We could not wait to get out of there. We come to the springs on a regular basis with our school group and we will never be back to this restaurant. We will do our lessons and go somewhere else to eat. Which is really very unfortunate.
"Just terrible.  We waited in line 40 minutes to order, at which time we first learned certain menu items (like French fries??) were no longer available.  Then we waited another 25 minutes for food that arrived cold.  No excuse."
"We're pretty pleased w/ Divine Cafe.  We've been coming out for lunch fairly regularly after spending the day at Spring's Preserve with our toddler son.  Lately I've been hooked on their  Angus burger, its loaded w/ your choice of cheese, 2 thick slices of bacon along w/ lettuce & tomato.  Its pretty filling plus all their sandwiches come w/ french fries, sweet potato tots or chips.  My hubby likes their turkey wrap and my son loves their kid's cheese pizza, it comes out piping hot so be careful w/ your lil ones.  Our total this afternoon, w/ our 10% member discount came to ~$27 including 2 Honest Teas and a kids drink, which comes w/ the kid's meal.  For fast casual the food is pretty darn good and priced very reasonably."
My family and I eat here every time we visit the preserve and the food is delicious and the staff there are friendly and the views from the balcony are breathtaking
"Horrible service. And by horrible, I mean no service at all. They were open later than normal today so we (my 2 year old and I) decided to have a bite. Unfortunately when we arrived, we weren't greeted, but eventually one Male employee told us where we could sit due to an event they were having. We opted to sit outside and nearly 10 minutes later were still not waited on. At that point we decided to leave. I let a waitress know the situation on my way out, but she didn't really seem to care. Especially disappointed because earlier today I joined the Springs Preserve as a new member with a restaurant discount as one of the perks.

Note: I have eaten here a few times before. Service is never great, but acceptable. Food is average, I like the children's options for my son."
"Limited menu, but food is good. Good kids menu... Good service nice staff. Lots of seating indoor or outdoor."
Everything about the Springs Preserve is amazing--including this restaurant. The food is excellent and the presentation is beautiful. This is a wonderful place to enjoy a nice day with family and friends. The Divine Salad is one of the best salads I've had.
"My wife and I hosted a group of 45 and arranged a tour of the Springs Preserves with lunch following the tour at the Divine Cafe.  Working with John was a pleasure and along with the staff made our lunch the best experience we could ever of hoped to have.  In a group or dining by yourself, this is one of the best places in Las Vegas for a great meal.  The staff is second to none.  Did we mention the view of downtown?"
"Gorgeous location at the Springs Preserve with views of the strip and valley!

This place is so pretty and it has so many details that I love from the decor, fresh flowers to the lighting. 

Why the 2 stars? 

The food here is just awful. I've been here multiple times and I remember the good ol' days when Wolfgang Puck was running the show. Here are my thoughts -

The teriyaki chicken bowl serves up precooked chicken and frozen veggies on mushy rice with a very heavy bottled teriyaki sauce. Skip it.

The turkey wrap comes with wet meat. Yep, wet in just a wrong way. It's also cut into 3 pieces without any tucked end so when you take a bite everything falls out of it. The fries aren't fresh.  Skip it.

The pizza is ok. The crust is too thick & chewy for my liking but it's way better than the other items mentioned above. 

The salads are probably the better options here as well but the meat is still precooked. 

The chicken Milanese is dry and the chicken is sad as it's just been reheated most likely in a microwave. 

This review in general just makes me sad. I love the location and space but the food just tastes awful. I hope somebody brings a new seasonal menu to this location and stops serving precooked meat. Also, the prices are far too high for this kind of quality."
"Next time you're bored on a Thursday, come to Springs Preserve for a quick trail run... then swing into the Divine Cafe for Happy Hour from 4-8PM! Or just do the HH, I won't tell anyone.

The fact that a museum/park restaurant has decent food is already a delightful surprise, but throw in a liquor license and happy hour and you've actually got something pretty unique. HH features live jazz and a limited menu of appetizers and seasonal cocktails, not to mention the phenomenal view.

KETTLE CHIPS: Brought to the table upon seating, decently fresh and nicely seasoned. Provided ranch for dipping? A fresh salsa would be way better!
DEVILED EGGS: four egg halves topped with kalamata olives, simple but tasty, with a low $4 price tag.
CHEESEBURGER SLIDERS: Nice chargrilled taste, thick patties, topped with lettuce, tomato, and burger sauce.
ARTICHOKE AND CHICKEN NAAN: The highlight of our mini-meal! Served like a sandwich, think of a Panini made of naan, filled with cheese, artichoke, a bit of spinach, and strips of grilled chicken. This would make a good lunch option, generous portion.

In addition to all that tasty food, the service changes from walk-up to table service when they transition to HH. The young ladies who attended to us were super friendly and genuine. Looking forward to coming back!"
"Here for New Year's Eve. It opened at 9:30, it's now 10pm. Pizza is cold and they are out of cocktails. 

Also apparently it of napkins.... 

2 hours to go.... waste of $50."
"Love this place 
Food is amazing 
Love the views and lots of space inside and out 
Kids friendly and and it's great for cocktails and group gatherings"
"There aren't many restaurants more ""under the radar"" than Divine Cafe at Springs Preserve. It's out of the way for most tourists visiting the Strip or Downtown and it's a destination most locals don't think of when looking for a meal, unless you're also visiting the exhibits at Springs Preserve. With a kitchen led by Steve Piamchuntar (former chef and owner of Nosh & Swig) they're serving up some surprisingly good dishes for lunch and brunch.

Chef Steve has brought his refined skills and whimsical and modern touch to this cafe. With their recently changed menu they're offering a diverse menu with plenty for adults and kids, alike. Standard American fare like caesar salads, burgers, and pizzas are available. While the burger ($9.50) was decent, non-typical dishes make this place shine compared to other cafes in town. Singapore chicken cups ($9.50) are lettuce wraps with balanced sweetness and savoriness. The pressed chicken milanese ($11) is a must. It eats like a sandwich but has flavors that are fitting for any larger meal. For brunch the pan dulce french toast ($8) was great. More like a creamy bread pudding with bread soaked through with custard, it's perfect for those wanting to satisfy their sweet tooth early in the day. And, to polish off a meal try the root beer float ($6). It's accompanied by an Oreo dusted churro that's as good as any you'll find in town.

My meal was fully comped, but I did tip appropriately. They're typically only open for lunch or brunch, but are open Thursdays and have happy hour specials and live music."
"Went here to meet a girlfriend for lunch. Have lived here for a little over 3 years and this was my first visit. It kind looks like a cafeteria except you order your food they give you a number, you serve your own drinks and find a place to sit (we sat outside as the weather was nice and we had a beautiful view of the strip). Prices are reasonable (it cost me a little over $17 for entree and drink)food was good. I forgot to take photos of the food but the presentation was nice. They offered complimentary tortilla chips and salsa (without a tray, things were a little difficult to manage) as we headed to a table. I ordered the fish and chips and my friend order the Monte Cristo sandwich with sweet potato waffle fries. We enjoyed ourselves. Birds like to come and are pretty daring, they will swoop down and take whatever is attended to very quickly. Parking is free. This is a nice place to visit with kids or out of town guests. I also went to the gift shop and with Checkin on Yelp you get 20% off so needed up purchasing a book for my grandson."
"Have always enjoyed Springs Preserve Happy Hour on Thursday's, love the view and the complementary potato chips and dip...Sometimes the Happy Hour Menu options leave a lot to be desired but I know they change it up periodically. This visit I did the supreme pizza and my girlfriend had the kids meal of chicken fingers... She loves the bird and sometimes we have trouble finding a happy hour that has basic chicken options, she is not one for the fancy foods... anyway she was pleased... Drink options are great as well... Love the fact that their happy hour runs until 8pm... most have shut down by 6. Hopefully at some point they will do it every night of the week but I will continue to enjoy this ""hidden gem"" in the desert. Spread the word folks"
"I find the sandwiches and pizza's here good,and the kids menu has pretty good stuff like mac n cheese but the downside is when we went and got dessert it had nuts and we asked them if it had nuts and they denied it and my brother got sick but over all it's a pretty good place to have brunch"
"I absolutely love the ambiance. My kids love having lunch there, especially the crunchy tater tots. I personally enjoy the nicoise salad. When I lived in California I used to go to the Getty Museum every summer, but being here in Vegas now, the Springs preserve is the next best thing. Lastly, the outdoor Veranda is the perfect place to have lunch. The view is so relaxing."
"Arrived here for a noon lunch, very friendly cashier and large clean area.
Menu has a lot of healthy options, salad and burgers, pizza and desserts.
I ordered the quinoa and cauliflower salad and my son ordered the burger and fries which was brought to our table.  Would have liked to sit near the window to enjoy the lovely view, but reserved signs were on every one, so we had to take an inner table.  The was the option to sit outside, but much too cold at 57 degrees.  The salad was huge and tasty and my son devoured the burger which looked delicious.  Fries were also very good with some pepper and other spices added.  Our plates were bussed by a very nice man and all the workers were pleasant.  Glad we got there early, by the time we left 45 minutes later, there was a long line to order and tables were packed with parents and kids."
I love eating here. Such a sweet and peaceful environment with delcious food. My favorite is the curry chicken pizza! Absolutely delicious. The portions are generous and I'm never dissatisfied when I dine here.
"I'm increasing the rating for the professional and completely appropriate response of management -- this is how business owners should respond.  Unfortunately, we are just visiting town and do not have time to stop again, but I do appreciate professionalism and constructive responses from business owners."
"I truly enjoyed my Memorial Day lunch here with the family. Came to the Spring Preserve butterfly exhibit and had lunch at Divine Cafe don't forget to check in I did you get a free drink! ;( next time! The view is amazing and the dinning room is huge. Very beautiful eating spot with a ginormous wrap around out door patio with lots of tables and chairs to eat  outside. 

The brisket sandwich was delicious in nice toasty pretzel bun and yummy bacon and crispy onions strips. The side season fries were perfect. My wife got the medium rare burger and it was juicy and yummy! The Cracker jack popcorn with candied pecans was really good and a sweet treat to end the meal. I really like the strawberry, lemon and mint infused water which is free of charge. 

All in all very good place to eat I definitely come back eat here again fairly priced, flavorful food, great view and atmosphere and the service is super friendly!"
The springs cafe has changed. New name and new menu. A meal per person on average will cost $10. I ordered a hamburger and it fell apart. I ordered the kids mac and cheese for my 8 year old and the Mac and cheese on the plate was about 2 tablespoons worth of Mac and cheese. This place is not the same. The exquisite food by the culinary school is gone. Unlikely I will be returning. This is a big disappointment since I have a pass and come here often with my family. I will be eating outside of springs preserve now.
"Such a great place. Such great staff but month after month, small ticks in the menu are finally piling up to a point where visitors will only find charm in the location and the people. 

We walked the trails and enjoyed the gardens that only the lucky and learned know. There are many gems at the Springs Preserve and one of them is the Divine Cafe. No visit is without the splendid view and friendly staff. Any visitor to Las Vegas who want to see what the potential for sustainable living in the desert is like they should visit this wonderful place. And if you have a peckish, snack at the Divine Cafe. 

First time visitors will be pleased with the cleanliness, the helpful staff but what they won't see is the diminished more expensive menu. Just a few months ago you had so many more options at price points that would make visitors want to sign up for annual memberships. 

It's happening slowly. Some wraps gone... then the hummus is gone, then the flatbread. A glorious menu is dwindling in the desert sun. 

Then the worst of the worst.  We were given plastic utensils with our lunch.  I'm not that snobby but Divine Cafe is too cool to be using plastic utensils. Maybe it was a mistake because we were able to get a proper place setting from the very kind staff member. -But what if she wasn't there?"
"Was hoping for a great lunch after enjoying the new Unearthed Dinosaurs Exhibit on the opening day of the exhibit, but it ended up being a slightly negative experience. First their was a bit of a wait to place our order with only one cashier, but stayed even keel. Once we placed our order they were out of chicken fingers, salmon, tacos, and eggs. This was around 1:15pm. Our order was placed and I had given indications to wait on the dessert ten minutes  after my three kids food came out. Their food came out and my food came out but we were still waiting for my husband's. They asked about the dessert and I extended for five more minutes. The five more minutes passed and went and we were still waiting. Oh, and still waiting on my husband's pizza. I saw someone else's pizza come out and they were several orders after ours. I spoke to an employee and they informed the manager. The manager came over and she informed us that the pizza was been cooked and they were going to reimburse us for it and still wanted to confirm that we wanted it. I said yes, and she came back and returned my cc after she processed refund. Still waiting on our dessert as well and I asked another employee what the status was after the pizza was finally brought to our table. The kiddos (four-years and under) we're now very antsy. Husband finished the pizza and we couldn't wait any longer. Asked for a refund and they didn't even have the desserts ready. I didn't realize how hard a s'more let alone two were so complicated to make. We left with a not so nice experience. Hope Nadiya and staff work on improving their restaurant's operation."
Mi lugar favorito la comida riquisima el hambiente muy relajante el servicion exelente .
"Sun filled cafe with great views set in the Springs Preserve. Great little lunchtime escape... Re-frames being in the city for just a little while.  The setting is great, and deserves a visit just for that... but the food is actually pretty good too!  
The chicken caprese sandwich with tater tots hit the spot... I was happy."
Great place to dine!! Food was delicious and prepared nice and quickly. The atmosphere was clean and family friendly.
This is a good foods to eat here. I do not mind just going here for to eat.  Service is typically 4 out of 5 stars.  Place is clean.  It gets surprisingly busy.  Cobb salad is bomb and kids love the pizza.  Wife had a Good  and yummy chips. Definitely want to try more.
"Okay let me tell you I was SO surprised at how good this place was! My colleagues and I stopped for lunch, and this place offered a variety of choices, even had some interesting and unique dishes, lunch specials, and healthy choices. Located at the springs preserve on valley view. Parking is free, and just a short walk upstairs from the lot. Access into springs preserve is not necessary. Space is big so room for you, or your group is accessible. They also have a balcony area which would be nice to sit at when you're stuck in an office all day like myself. And the food... so good!! Price is average, plates ranging from $10-$15, with sides up to $4."
"This is one of Vegas' best kept secrets, I am sure. Located at the awesome Springs Preserve, just across the way from the Meadows Mall, they serve up fantastic lunch specials daily, cater events, and have a room you can rent for small private events, which my book club does monthly. The patio offers an amazing view of the south valley, you can see all of the Strip and the downtown area from above the trees with literally no obstructions! Beautiful! And....on Thursdays, they stay open til 8pm with a special appetizers menu, Happy Hour drink pricing, and live music! I recommend the white sangria, and the beef sliders. There is rarely a crowd, which may not be good for their overhead (?), but I certainly enjoy having the view practically to myself. I take my out-of-town guests here, it is truly a gem."
The view from the outside seating is beautiful. The hummus is delicious. They accommodated my allergy and gave me cucumbers with my hummus. The salad was amazing! My friend had their soup and it was fresh and delicious. We both really enjoyed eating at the Spring Preserve.
"4.5 stars. We have been members for a couple of years now ,so eating here is something we always do.

the .5 star off is because sometimes the service can be slow. Even on slow days. Granted we tend to visit during slow days/hours but I just want to mention because it's obvious some people are really picky about the pace of service. 

We have never encountered a disgruntled employee. People are always nice and always seem to check up on us at least once before we leave.

My favorite thing about this place is that the menu does change. Follow them on instagram if you are looking for new menu items."
"Stopped into Divine cafe while waiting on my car to be worked on at Sears. Got to Cafe at 9:30, before they opened at 10am. But because it was cold outside, I was let in to wait inside until 10am...that was very kind. Ordered the monte cristo and tater tots. Phenomenal sandwich, and flavors of the meat and cheese showed easily through the corn flaked breading surrounding the sandwich. All complimented by the jelly based sauce generously spread around the platter. Sadly, it was Saturday, so no mimosas were available to take the breakfast to another level for me Great food taste selections, awesome presentation, awesome views of the city, and a courteous waitstaff make this a cool spot to take family or your partner for breakfast!"
"When you want to grab some good food. Nothing fancy just good food, and a chill spot this is the place to go! The place is nice, the view is nice! You have the option to sit inside, out in the patio. If the weather is good definitely sit outside. The fish tacos are great! All the kid plates are great they come with a variety of snacks for the kids! Also since this place is at springs preserve you can go to the trails and gardens for free, and let the kids run around!"
Tater tots were dripping with grease. The turkey quesadilla was poorly grilled and the lettuce used inside was a poor choice. The kids cheeseburger was the best part of it all.
"This used to be one of my favorite places have lunch of my day off with the family. 
We are not a fan of some of the changes. It's cool you want to cater to the vegetarian crowd, but you replaced signature fresh made sandwiches with a frozen Impossible burger. It's trendy... It's brand name... It's garbage. Serve a fresh made veggie burger or a black bean burgers. Don't serve frozen GMO food... You're better than that. This isn't Burger King.
Salads also took a turn with this menu change. The new plates they come on make eating the salads precarious. You try to push a serving onto your fork, and push half the salad off the back of the plate. The bowls were better. Ingredients are lacking on these salads too. The Southwest salads was one of my favorites in town. The Vegas Chop is just as expensive with about half the ingredients. 
Speed and service were still good, and the view can't be beat.... But I'm not sure how quickly I'll be back with this menu."
"Great Thursday evening happy hour, with live music.  Tonight, chilled to island style mellow tunes with bruddah Ryan and Iz, members of popular Vegas group, Haleamano.  Check out the drink specials and tasty pupus like the Buffalo wings with tangy Bleu cheese dip, hot cheesy spinach artichoke dip with toasted baguette slices, duck and sweet & spicy bacon  sliders, and creative street tacos.  Can't beat the view of the strip from the balcony.  Trult nice spot for couples and families."
"Excellent, great healthy food, great venue, great service. Very convenient . Friendly staff, tasty"
"Had a great time at the divine cafÃ© happy hour Thursday night. The band was awesome. Two-man band with Bob Cordova and Dave Vogel . 
Food was good they just need to work on the happy hour drink prices.
If these guys are playing again I'll be back."
"I love this restaurant at the Springs Preserve. It's simple food prepared well, with an idyllic view to boot. They serve a brunch on the weekends and, although I love brunch, I don't think they have a large selection. My husband loves their teas. And I love dining outside when the weather is nice. You can dine here even if you're not attending Springs Preserve, so it would be a nice place to go when it warms up."
"Ordered lunch here before exploring the preserve. I had to go the counter twice asking where my sandwich was - the other person I was with had finished lunch while I was still waiting. I then had to eat quickly so we could explore the grounds. 
PS - preserve is underwhelming."
"OK I was there for a private event. The service was great and the food was fantastic. So I reserve the right to add to this review when I eat at the restaurant proper. Until then, stop by and give them a try.  Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"
"I have to say, with the change away from Wolfgang Puck's name - it's a welcome change. I was getting tired of seeing the same things on the menu.

I have been here several times since the new change - and I have to admit, I like the new changes they have come up with. There are a few staples, but they also incorporate a lot of new dishes, and that has got my taste buds singing.

Last time I came out here I had the Bento Box, my daughter the grill cheese, and the other couple I was with shared a burger meal. I loved the Bento Box - a little greasy for the egg roll, but everything else was just right!

The specials are swapped out more frequently - and that is a good change to see! It's nice to see fresh ideas moving in, and get the future generations touch of good meals! You can definitely see the urge to please from the employees as you wait for your food. They show genuine concern for your happiness during your meal, and if things are delayed they are genuinely apologetic about it all! 

Might as well check out the rest of the preserves while you are there! (Or if you are there first, then might as well eat here!)"
"A Monte Cristo is by God a sandwich AND it is listed under the sandwich menu, so why the hell does it not come with the listed sides? The world may never know, as it pissed me off so much that we left.  I've had good food and enjoyed the good view  before, alas not today."
"I attended happy hour this past Thursday and left speechless as I got so much more than I ever expected.
Me and my son was greeted by a waitress as we walked in she was very kind and explained how things worked and even showed us a great seat.  Jessica was our server she was very friendly and went out of her way to acknowledge and interact with my son even asking him to dance. I ordered wings which were wonderful!  We will most definitely be back soon to see Jessica and all the friendly ladies for happy hour.."
"This cafe located in the Springs Preserve was such a nice lunch surprise on a Sunday afternoon...

Divine Service & Ambiance:  A friendly cashier takes your order and a staff member will deliver your food to the table from the kitchen.  The kitchen was great with getting our orders to the table rather quickly.  All the staff was so so friendly and greeted you with smiles.  Great positive vibes from all the employees we came across.  The open dining area has square, round and long rectangular tables take care of all the seating needs indoors and outdoors.  Earthly toned colors of pastel green and rows of hanging light bulbs make for an attractive dining area with a nature vibe.  There's a couple of flat screen tvs hanging from the walls as well.  The view of the city is amazing and makes for a great social media moment for your followers. =)

Divine Burger + Fries: The burger was prepped well and cooked medium rare as I requested from the kitchen.  This was a very tasty cheeseburger that can hold its own with restaurants much more expensive then this boutique cafe.  The seasoned fries were fresh and flavorful.  Both items were on the smaller serving side but high on the savory side so I'm good.  The coca cola drink station has an endless amount of flavorful soda combinations.

My expectations in any food outlet at a park, theme park, museum, etc is usually pretty low as I understand that the outlet is more of an amenity than anything else.  Divine cafe exceeds all those expectations and is a resto I'd consider stopping by whenever I'm on this side of town.   There's some items on the menu that I'd like try on the next visit but that's another tale.  Enjoy!"
"This spot is perfect for dates out with the girls, husband, and baby. The food is really delicious and well balanced. You do not need to pay admission into the Springs Preserve to eat here. The prime rib sandwich with an jus is my favorite! They have a nice selection of cold herbal teas. The view in the cafe is spectacular (You can see the strip.)"
"I had friends in town and ate at springs preserve.  My husband works at the water district and we were very hopeful that we would find a place for great brunch or happy hour.  I have to say this place has a lot of potential because of the great view but is poorly managed.  The only table service they have is one day a week for a really lame happy hour and Sunday brunch.  The rest of the service is go to the counter, order your food and they give you a giant placard for your table with a number on it.  And when I say giant, I mean it is a huge potato masher that is totally unnecessary.  When you to the counter to order your food, they give you the above-mentioned potato masher and send you off you off on your way.  And if you are in a party that has more than one person, who pays separately, you have multiple potato mashers.  So when the food comes out, it comes out sporadically, so if one person gets their food, the rest of the potato mashers have to wait for up to 20 minutes more to get their food.  Thus, making the rest of the table's food cold.  You can tell all the food was prepared the day before and in there fridge overnight, so it tastes like refrigerator.  And god forbid you order an adult beverage and you want a second.  You have to go back to the front counter to order that. Plus the music at times is inappropriately loud and you can hear customers complaining around you.  If you have a restaurant in a nature preserve, customers want to hear silence, or nature!   It is a very ill construed way to run a restaurant and I can't see it lasting for long under the present management, who I saw sitting in the corner and outside when tables were full of dirty dishes and needed clearing.  So in summary, bad management, average to bad food and servers that try really hard to take care of their clients but make no tips.  I would not recommend this restaurant under the current management."
"Had to send back Montecristo because it wasn't even warm. Got a new one which wasn't much warmer but ate it anyway. Tater tots were barely warm. The couple we were with (who ordered directly after we ordered) didn't get their food until we were done eating. This is the second time we've had food that wasn't hot. I hate to give up on this place because of the ambience, but we may have to."
"Honestly wasn't expecting much as it is a restaurant inside a park. But the food was better than expected.

The location is quite lovely. The view from the balcony was nice, You can see a lot of the attraction from there. The restaurant is pretty standard for a restaurant. Clean and well kept. And the staff and servers are nice and helpful.

The food was decent. I had the Divine burger. The burger itself was pretty good. I asked the burger to be medium rare and they cooked the patty as asked, the patty was also pretty thick. The only thing i really had a problem with was the bun. It was on the verge of being stale. 

The fries and tots were standard fast food fries/tots nothing special but they do serve a huge portion of it.

Overall im happy i came here. And will be back again for sure when i come visit the springs preserve."
"I love this cafe. Whenever I'm in need of a quiet place to just chill, I come here. Divine Cafe is located on the second floor of the Springs Preserve and you don't have to purchase a ticket to get to the cafe either. There's a flight of stairs near the parking lot that will take you upstairs to the cafe, easy peasy.

The menu is a bit pricey, but I do enjoy the food here, and I've been slowly working my way through the menu. They also serve alcohol if you want something like that while you eat. When I ordered dessert (the Churro Ice Cream Sandwich, by the way. Super tasty!), I asked if it could come later compared to my sandwich so it wouldn't melt, and the lady behind the register had no problems with that. Yay!

I can't forget to talk about the view. Springs Preserve is gorgeous and, from the second floor, you can easily see the Strip in the distance. You can either sit inside the cafe or on the balcony.

There's also a happy hour every Thursday from 4 to 8pm that I've been meaning to go to because it looks awesome.

Divine Cafe is a hidden gem within Las Vegas that you should definitely try out when you get the chance."
Best view to work and have lunch. I always order their tuna melt and GF chocolate chip cookies. I wish they had a full coffee menu but the food is still amazing.
"Just toured around the Springs Preserve for 2 hours and worked up an appetite! Divine Cafe to the rescue since it's conveniently located on property. A cold beverage and something savory to eat was on my mind. So as soon as we left the gift shop, we walked right upstairs to Divine Cafe.

Decided on just a quick bite, so we ordered Flat Bread with pepperoni and two fountain drinks. Total was about $20 including tip. Best snack ever! Perfect for me and my nephew. It was so good, we shared the last slice. ""Okay, I'll take one bite and you can have the rest!"" Cheesy, generous pepperoni, light tomato base, and perfectly toasted. Hit the spot! Also, there's a nice selection of unsweetened iced teas, a Coca-Cola freestyle machine, and berry infused water.

The dining area is so nice, clean, and spacious, with a wonderful view of the Springs Preserve and in the distance, The Strip and a mountain range. I'm thinking Sunrise Mountains, but please correct me if I'm wrong.

Well worth the stop for a snack or complete meal while visiting the Preserve. I could even see this as a great place for ladies who lunch!! Admission to the Springs Preserve is not required to dine in here! Indoor and outdoor seating available. Enjoy!!"
